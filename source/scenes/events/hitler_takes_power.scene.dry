[? if hitler_deported and president != "Hitler" and chancellor != "Hitler": The first act that Chancellor [+ chancellor +] takes upon assuming office is bringing Adolf Hitler back to Germany, and giving him citizenship and an official cabinet position. ?]

Hitler has promised a campaign of revenge against the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span>, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have already spilled much blood on the streets. In his published manifesto, he promises a campaign of <span style="color: #7e0000;">**unspeakable**</span> <span style="color: #3f0000;">**horror**</span> against our <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jews</span>, and endless wars of violent expansion that will ruin all of Europe.

What are we to do now?

- @fight: We will fight on the streets to prevent Hitler from taking power.
- @give_up: We will vote against the nazis in the Reichstag.


@fight

Do we realize that this means civil war, against the full force of the state?

- @civil_war: Yes.
- @give_up: We are not ready for war. Instead, we will vote against the nazis in the Reichstag.

Speeches are made. Votes are held. Bullets fly in the streets. Some <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> are killed or jailed. Others flee the country. What can votes even do at this juncture?

The Reichstag is burned, ostensibly by a foreign <span style="color: #700000;">communist</span>. In the wake, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> pass decrees giving them unlimited power. They, combined with the [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if dnf_formed: <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span>?], will win a majority at the next elections.

Germany is lost.

- @game_over: Game over.
