= Prussian Landtag referendum

After months of intense and polarizing propaganda from both sides, the day of the plebiscite has arrived. For it to pass, over 50% of the eligible Prussian population must vote in favor—not just a majority of those who cast their ballots. Like the Young Plan referendum, this high threshold makes success nearly impossible. However, even a strong showing by the anti-democratic forces could give them significant momentum.

[? if landtag_ref_kpd: The <span style="color: #700000;">red</span>-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">brown</span> coalition—once unthinkable—is now a reality. <span style="color: #700000;">**Communist**</span>, <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**Nazi**</span> and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> officials are sitting at the same tables at the polling stations, under the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">swastika</span> and the <span style="color: #700000;">Soviet star</span>. ?]

[? if landtag_ref_votes < 25: The referendum has failed, with only [+ landtag_ref_votes +]% of the Prussian population voting in favor. Support for the referendum was lower than expected, barely exceeding the number of signatures collected months ago. This suggests that public sentiment has remained largely unchanged since then. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> is demoralized and has suffered significant financial losses.
