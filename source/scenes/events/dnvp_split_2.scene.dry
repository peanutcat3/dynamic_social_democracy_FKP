= <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> Moderates split!

The moderate anti-Hugenberg wing of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> had already decided to break with the party, and it was only a matter of finding the right pretext. This opportunity came when Hugenberg passed a resolution to strengthen his <i>Führerprinzip</i> over the party, making the decisions of the party executive committee and leader binding on all members of the party’s delegations to the Reichstag and state parliaments.

The moderates within the party were powerless to stop the adoption of the resolution, which led to Westarp and the remaining moderates splitting off into various parties on the moderate German right.

- @dnvp_split: About time.

Unfortunately, the party district organizations remain loyal to Hugenberg, who has worked to fill the party bureaucracy with his own supporters. As a result, the defection of the entire moderate wing of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> is less impactful than it would have been. Furthermore, many on the right believe that an internal resolution is not a strong enough pretext to break with the party and may choose to remain with Hugenberg.
