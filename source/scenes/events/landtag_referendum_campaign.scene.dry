= Prussian Landtag referendum

[? if landtag_ref_kpd: The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> has reversed its position and now supports the referendum! It’s astonishing that the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, which labels us <span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>, is now collaborating with [+ nsdap_leader +] and Hugenberg. They have rebranded the referendum as the "red plebiscite" following an unacceptable ultimatum to the Prussian government. The <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> have mobilized so extensively that many now believe they have "taken the lead" in directing the campaign from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. ?][? if not landtag_ref_kpd: Fortunately, the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>[? if kpd_leader == "Thälmann": &nbsp;despite its <span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascist</span> stance toward us,] has refrained from taking a position on the referendum. The relatively low signature count of only [+ landtag_ref_signatures +] is a positive sign, making a victory for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> highly unlikely. ?]

[? if landtag_ref_kpd: The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>’s newfound support for the referendum has dramatically altered the situation, crushing earlier optimism stemming from the low number of signatures gathered in the first phase. Fortunately, many <span style="color: #700000;">**Communist**</span> workers are disgusted by the "<span style="color: #700000;">red</span>-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">brown</span>" plebiscite. Likewise, many <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> voters are reluctant to cast their ballots in alignment with the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.?][? if not landtag_ref_kpd: Even though this referendum is doomed to fail, it still provides the German Right with an opportunity to deepen political polarization, as evidenced by the anti-democratic rightwards shift of the bourgeois parties.?]

With our control of the Prussian government, we can campaign using state resources.

- @do_campaign: Let’s review our campaign options.
- @no_campaign: We shouldn't allocate resources to this.

We argue that the Young Plan is simply the most rational choice for Germany. Although it doesn't advance any broader political objectives, most people can get behind economic stability and recovery. [? if (z_relation >= 50 and (dvp_relation >= 40 and ddp_relation >= 40 and dvp_ideology != "Right" and not lvp_formed) or (lvp_relation >= 40 and lvp_ideology != "Right" and lvp_formed)): The bourgeois parties have rallied with us to campaign against the referendum and for the Young Plan.&nbsp;?][? if radio >= 2: Our radio network has helped us spread our message.&nbsp;?]

Great news! The <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span> has approved the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>'s participation in our propaganda campaign against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>.

However, this display of left-wing unity has frightened the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">liberals</span>, with some even choosing to support the referendum to protest.

The effect of this campaign depends on the strength of our already established media empire. [? if commercialized_media: Our commercialized newspapers and radio stations have been effective in persuading the middle classes to stay home. ?][? if radio: Our radio station has played a crucial role in reaching middle-class voters. ?][? if campaign_media: The widespread presence of <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> propaganda among the working-class has helped sway some to our side. ?]

Carl Severing and Otto Braun have successfully persuaded Brüning to issue another emergency decree, forcing 2,500 newspapers—regardless of their political stance or position on the plebiscite—to publish a government statement urging the public to abstain from voting.

This decision has further inflamed the already volatile political climate, prompting President Hindenburg to promise a review of the decree following strong backlash from the supporters of Hugenberg and Hitler.
