Our voter base mainly consists of the working-class and the unemployed, they expect us to enact the following policies during our tenure, or we will suffer consequences. [? if labor_minister_party != "SPD": So far, ceding control of the Labor Ministry to the bourgeois parties has left a poor impression with the workers. ?]

[? if spd_in_government : - Expand social welfare programs. ?]

[? if spd_in_government : - Promote worker ownership of industries. ?]

[? if spd_in_government : - Lower taxes or shift the tax burden to the wealthy. ?]

[? if spd_in_government : - Support workers in labor disputes. ?]

[? if spd_in_government : - Fund unemployment insurance through employers. ?]

[? if spd_in_government: - Advance women's rights. ?]

[? if spd_in_government: - Reform or expand education for workers. ?]

[? if spd_in_government and black_thursday_seen : - Institute an economic plan. ?]

[? if spd_in_government : - Secure low food prices for workers. ?]

[? if spd_in_government : - Reduce funding for the Reichswehr. ?]
