= Fifth Emergency Decree for Economy and Finance

With the abolishment of reparation payments and Brüning's government surviving the intrigues of [? if president == "Hindenburg": Hindenburg's inner circle?][? if president != "Hindenburg": his supporting parties?] for the time being, Dietrich's public works program has officially been granted its full billion-dollar funding!

This marks a real turning point, and along with the abolishment of reparations, the radicalizing effects of sky-high unemployment and the Versailles Treaty are diminished. The set of conditions that have enabled their meteoric rise begins to unravel, depriving them of the fuel that once drove their ascent.

Despite Brüning's belief that public works should come only after the economic depression has bottomed out, it seems like he finally believes that it has done so, with a global recovery on the horizon after the abolishment in Germany's reparations. The plan is similar to the previously proposed Lautenbach plan in many aspects, although with a more limited expansion of credit due to inflationary fears.
