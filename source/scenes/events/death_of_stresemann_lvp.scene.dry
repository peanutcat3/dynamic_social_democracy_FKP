Gustav Stresemann, former leader of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and longtime foreign minister, has died at the tragically young age of 51. He was the primary force driving the right of the party to support democracy; without him, the democratic forces in the Republic will be so much weaker. 

A hole has been left within the liberal movement, with the business wing of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> now likely to show significantly less willingness to cooperation with us.
