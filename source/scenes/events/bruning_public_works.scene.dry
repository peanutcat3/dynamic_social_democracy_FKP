= Fifth Emergency Decree for Economy and Finance

With Brüning focused on securing a foreign policy victory, the [? if z_party_name != "CVP":<span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP":<span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]'s Labor Minister Adam Stegerwald and the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?]'s Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Hermann Dietrich have been developing a job creation program. However, given the state of the national budget, such a program was not feasible without either severe welfare cuts or a breakthrough on reparations—delaying action until now due to fears of public backlash.

Dietrich has since proposed raising 1.4 billion Reichsmarks through a bond issue and secured Reichstag authorization for it. However, the Reichsbank remains hesitant to support the plan financially, at least until the reparations question is settled at Lausanne in the coming months. As a result, the cabinet has scaled back Dietrich’s proposal, allocating only 135 million Reichsmarks and introducing additional austerity measures in the next emergency decree. The decree’s main feature is the creation of a new "Voluntary Labor Service" brigade, tasked with draining swamps and digging artificial lakes—at subminimum wages.

Should Lausanne bring success, full funding for Dietrich’s program may still follow. Brüning just has to survive until then.

title: The decree is to be presented in the near future.

With relations between Brüning and Hindenburg increasingly strained, it would take nothing short of a miracle for this to be implemented in time. Nonetheless, it marks a turning point—and aligns with Stegerwald’s promise to the unions for job creation made just a month ago.
