= Coup in Prussia

A crisis! President [+ president +] has invoked the *Reichsexekution* to dismiss the Prussian government, citing its "inability to maintain order" amidst escalating clashes between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, Reichsbanner, and the increasingly militant <span style="color: #700000;">**RFB**</span>. However, the true motivation is clear: the left-wing coalition governing Prussia poses a direct threat to the conservative and nationalist establishment in Germany.

The legality of this action remains highly questionable. The left-wing coalition has vowed to resist, while the streets are descending into chaos with mass protests and rising political violence.

subtitle: Labor will call a general strike. The Reichsbanner and the loyal elements of the Prussian police will resist the coup. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> remains unwavering in its support.

The Reichswehr and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> are already surrounding Berlin, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is supporting them. This could be civil war. We do realize that, correct?

Our combined forces confront the government troops and their reactionary auxiliaries, and somehow, our enemies retreat without a fight! They were overwhelmed by our display of strength, and have chosen to slink away. President [+ president +] withdraws the dismissal of the Prussian government, at least for now.

The show of force has reinvigorated support for the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, and has weakened the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>.

@defend_2_civil_war

Our forces confront the government troops and their supporters on the streets of Berlin, and armed fighting erupts. The reactionaries do not budge from their positions. We are caught at a disadvantage.

- @civil_war: It is a civil war.

The <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span> who resist are brutally suppressed, and without the support of the Reichsbanner, we are forced to surrender the Prussian government to the reactionaries. A pall of hopelessness and despair descends over <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democracy</span>. We have failed. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> will never trust us again. Many in the Reichsbanner simply quit, demoralized by their leaders' lack of a call to action.

Hindenburg appoints the reactionary Franz von Papen to govern over Prussia as a *Reichskommissar*, charged with dismantling the democratic systems we worked hard to build.
