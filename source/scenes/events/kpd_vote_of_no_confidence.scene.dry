= Vote of No Confidence

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> has called a vote of no confidence against us, due to our various policies and disagreements. If this succeeds, there will be an election in a few months.

How do we assuage the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>?

- @resources: Use our resources to reduce dissent within the coalition.
- @thalmann: Appoint Thälmann as chancellor instead of [+ chancellor +].

on-arrival: chancellor = "Thälmann"; chancellor_party = "KPD"

With great reluctance, President [+ president +] appoints [+ chancellor +] as chancellor.

Immediately, [+ chancellor +] goes to work building a "<span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Germany</span>": consolidating as much power as possible in the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, purging state institutions of anti-<span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>, and sending street fighters against the "enemies of the people".

In response to [+ chancellor +] being appointed Chancellor, the right-wing forces launches almost immediately launch an attempted coup. Troops of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! <span style="color: #808080;">Reactionary</span> officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> to stop the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> from taking power. We are forced to be on the same side as the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, whether we want to or not.

By transferring resources to our coalition partners, we can reduce their dissent against our policies. This is a crude, but effective solution.

We could try to boot the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> from our governing coalition, and form a new government with the bourgeois parties.

The vote succeeds, and our government has resigned. Chancellor Brüning has been appointed as the head of an acting government, consisting solely of the bourgeois parties.

[? if not bruning_event_seen and year >= 1930: New elections haven't been called yet but it's likely that they will be soon, considering Brüning most likely doesn't have the majority of the Reichstag behind him. ?]
