= Bourgeois Parliamentary Group Formed

It was only through further encouragement from industrialist donors that the bourgeois parties has come together to form a parliamentary alliance, which includes the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, <span style="color: #b8996f;">**WP**</span>, and <span style="color: #7FCEB1;">**CNBLP**</span>. This alliance was later joined by the <span style="color: #007A00;">German Peasants' Party</span>[? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical":&nbsp;and even the [? if not kvp_formed: splitters from the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">DNVP</span>?][? if kvp_formed: <span style="color: #0087DC;">KVP</span>?]?].

Although these are the affairs of the bourgeois, it still impacts us. The parliamentary alliance has an underlying anti-<span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> agenda, and we will need to invest considerable effort into breaking apart the group in order to negotiate with its members individually.
