= The Second Brüning cabinet

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s Julius Curtius has resigned from the Foreign Ministry following the disastrous failure of the Austro-German customs union, which he was the architect of. With no more <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> ministers in cabinet, the last obstacle preventing them from breaking with Brüning's government has been removed. In an attempt to maintain their support, Brüning has formed a more conservative second cabinet, but this effort has proven insufficient—the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> has now joined the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span>, which also remains opposed to cooperating with his government.

With the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> now likely to vote alongside the extremist parties, the government's majority is at risk. If the remaining bourgeois parties follow suit, Brüning’s cabinet may no longer hold control. We must now decide whether to continue tolerating this more right-leaning Brüning government—now absent of leftist figures such as the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>’s Joseph Wirth—in the hopes the bourgeois parties reconsidering their opposition, or to finally break away from it.

call: set_next_election_time

We have officially broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, voting against them in a vote of no confidence. Continuing to support such a government would go against all our values. The bourgeois parties have also joined in, choosing to cut their losses rather than engage in a futile attempt to save Brüning’s government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The <span style="color: #b8996f;">**WP**</span> has unexpectedly reversed its opposition to Brüning's government following last-minute concessions from the Chancellor. In a crucial no-confidence vote, they sided with the government, effectively neutralizing the impact of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s withdrawal. Additionally, some members of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s left wing, including Curtius and Otto Thiel, either voted with the government or abstained.

This sudden shift by the <span style="color: #b8996f;">**WP**</span> has all but sealed its political demise. Already struggling to maintain support among the middle class, the party now faces mass defections, with local chapters either dissolving or breaking away entirely.

Despite the formation of a more right-leaning cabinet, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span> remains unwilling to support Brüning, as they seek to claim full control for themselves.

We are once again compelled to vote in favor of the [+ chancellor +] government to prevent the extremist parties on the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">left</span> from translating their growing popular support into parliamentary gains. Some members of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s left wing, such as Curtius and Otto Thiel, have also voted with the government or abstained, going against their wider party.

Despite the new right-wing cabinet, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span> is still refusing to support Brüning, as they want all the power to themselves.
