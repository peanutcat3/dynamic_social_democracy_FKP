Our budget situation should improve somewhat.

[? if spd_in_government and foreign_minister_party == "SPD": Even though this is not our accomplishment, our foreign ministry is eager to take credit for this accomplishment. ?][? if not spd_in_government and foreign_minister_party != "SPD": Even though this is not the work of the foreign ministry, it is eager to take credit for this accomplishment. ?]
