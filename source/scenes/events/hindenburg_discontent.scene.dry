= Hindenburg Voices Disapproval

President Hindenburg has made his dissatisfaction with the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> presence in government clear and would use his presidential powers to remove us by force—if he actually had them.

However, Hindenburg still holds great sway over the bourgeois parties and, along with his influential inner circle, has pressured them to break with our government.
