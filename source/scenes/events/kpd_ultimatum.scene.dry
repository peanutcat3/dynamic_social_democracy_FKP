= <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> Goals

At the start of this government, the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> presented a list of goals for the coalition:

[? if welfare_goal = 1 : - Expand social welfare programs - [? if welfare_goal_completed : success ?][? if not welfare_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if agriculture_goal = 1 : - Enact a land reform program. - [? if agriculture_goal_completed : success ?][? if not agriculture_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if economy_goal = 1 : - Start substantial nationalization of the economy. - [? if economy_goal_completed : success ?][? if not economy_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if finance_goal = 1 : - Make taxes more progressive. - [? if finance_goal_completed : success ?][? if not finance_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if labor_goal = 1 : - Support workers in labor disputes. - [? if labor_goal_completed : success ?][? if not labor_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if foreign_goal = 1 : - Improve our relations with the <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span>. - [? if foreign_goal_completed : success ?][? if not foreign_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if reichswehr_goal = 1 : - Reduce funding for the Reichswehr. - [? if reichswehr_goal_completed : success ?][? if not reichswehr_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

Unfortunately, we have failed to accomplish all of the goals the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> set out. They plan to call a vote of no confidence against our government, and have already begun mounting a propaganda campaign to delegitimize our government in the eyes of the workers.

- @appeal: Appeal to the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span> to have patience - we are trying!
- @kpd_vote_of_no_confidence.support_center: Could we form a new government based on the <span style="color: #000000;">**Center Party**</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> (and possibly <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>)?
- @kpd_vote_of_no_confidence.let_it_happen: Let the vote happen.
- @no_vonc: They cannot call a vote of no confidence due to the constitutional reforms, but they can obstruct our government at every opportunity.

unavailable-subtitle: [? if kpd_score < 4: They do not see us as serious in trying to achieve the goals of the coalition. ?] [? if kpd_relation < 50: Our relations are too poor. ?] [? if kpd_appeal_seen = 1: we do not have any more time. ?]

We argue that we are working hard to achieve the coalition's goals, and in the name of proletarian solidarity, we must make this coalition function. Surprisingly, the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> hears our pleas, and is willing to give us six more months before the coalition goals must be achieved.

Against all expectations, the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>'s goals have all been met! Apparently the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> did not prepare for this eventuality, a worker's government successfully built through democratic means. They will continue to "tolerate" our government for the rest of our term, while still acting as a watchdog against bourgeois backsliding.

We have been effectively made a minority government, and the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> intends to obstruct our attempts to pass policy.
