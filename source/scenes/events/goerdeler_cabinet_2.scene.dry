= Goerdeler I Collapses

With Hugenberg and [+ nsdap_leader +]'s intransigence—and their irreconcilable differences with the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> and President Hindenburg—Goerdeler’s position is untenable. In a vote of no confidence, the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has abandoned him, leaving only the minor parties between the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> and the [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span>?] backing his government.

Despite this embarrassment and show of unpopularity by the Goerdeler government, Schleicher and the Camarilla see this as an opportunity. He expects that, with the exodus of voters from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> and the certainty of their collapse next election, they will be forced to become more sensible. 

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
