= The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s Proposal

With the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s disastrous showing last election, only winning [+ ddp_r +]% of seats, they've reconsidered our offer for an electoral list connection. Even Heuss is convinced that they need to do something. 

- @ddp_alliance_yay: The party votes...

After their internal vote, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> accepts our offer. The party suffers electorally from their association with us, even if many right-wingers stress it as nothing more than a technical list connection. Anyhow, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> will receive more parliamentary seats now.

[? if ddp_ideology == "Left" and ddp_leader == "Lemmer": Lemmer has decided to take things a step further, and has further increased electoral cooperation between our parties. Perhaps this alliance will last more than just one election? ?]
