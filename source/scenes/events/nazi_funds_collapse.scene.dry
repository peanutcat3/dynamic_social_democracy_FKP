= The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span>'s Funding Crisis

# trigger when schleicher calls election

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>'s coffers, drained by a relentless string of electoral campaigns, are finally empty. Drastic changes to the party’s operations are now unavoidable—none of which sit well with the top <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> officials accustomed to lavish lifestyles and generous salaries. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, already bitter over their perceived lack of support, won’t be pleased either.

Borrowing is no longer an option; creditors are demanding repayment of old debts before offering anything new. As a result, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> campaign will face significant cutbacks. Proposals for “creative” alternatives—like having the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> resort to street-level theft—are, unsurprisingly, not particularly popular with the public.

Until the grassroots funding the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> once relied on recovers, the party will be operating on a strict budget in the coming months. Even the proceeds from *Mein Kampf*—previously funneled into funding Hitler’s lavish lifestyle—are now being redirected to keep the party afloat.
