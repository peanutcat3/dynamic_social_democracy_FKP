= <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> Congress

The victory of the moderates within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> has not entirely halted the party’s rightward shift since its electoral defeat. Hergt’s triumph over the democratic Young Conservatives, led by Treviranus, has dashed our hopes for a more democratic and constructive <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.

While the initial turmoil following Hugenberg’s split and the Young Plan has subsided, a rightward shift in the party’s policies remains possible, especially as the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> threatens to eclipse them. The ongoing crisis in Germany continues to radicalize the electorate—and, by extension, the bourgeois parties that represent them.

- @statusquo: Hergt has once again won re-election.
- @schiele: The mantle is transferred to Martin Schiele and the Agrarians.

Oskar Hergt has been re-elected once again. However, he and the national conservatives within the party are increasingly looking toward alliances with forces to their right, as their previous hostility toward the <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span> continues to fade. Furthermore, the bourgeois elites influencing the party have pushed its leadership to reconsider some form of cooperation with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, aiming to integrate them as a "constructive component of the state" through a so-called 'taming' strategy.

Recently, discussions have emerged about a new referendum—one designed to unite the German right, much like the Young Plan referendum attempted, but this time focused on prematurely dissolving the Prussian Landtag. Given the radicalized political climate, such a move would allow the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, which currently holds a meager [+ nsdap_r_prussia +] seats, to make significant gains.

[? if land_reform >= 1 : Due to the land reform policies enacted by our[? if not spd_in_government:&nbsp;previous?] government, the agrarian conservative elites have made it their strongest effort to rally the German right against them. This involves orchestrating a leadership change within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, the primary political home of agrarian conservatism. Oskar Hergt has been persuaded to resign, in favor of the president of the National Rural League (RLB), Martin Schiele. They hope that by electing the most influential figure in the agricultural community, they can safeguard the relevance of organized agriculture within Germany. ?][? if rural_spd_normalized >= 30 and land_reform == 0 : With the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> making significant inroads among rural voters, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> and its agrarian elites have persuaded Oskar Hergt to resign, passing the party's leadership to Martin Schiele, the president of the National Rural League (RLB). They hope that the most influential figure in the agricultural community can stem the tide and maintain the historic bond between agriculture and German conservatism in the years ahead. ?][? if rural_nsdap_normalized >= rural_dnvp_normalized and rural_spd_normalized < 30 and land_reform == 0 : Due to the significant inroads made by the insurgent <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> among their primary rural voter base, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> and its agrarian elites have persuaded Oskar Hergt to step down, passing the party’s leadership to Martin Schiele, president of the National Rural League (RLB).

Schiele’s election has led to the merger of the <span style="color: #7FCEB1;">**CNBLP**</span> into the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, strengthening its hold on the countryside and uniting the RLB in lobbying for agrarian interests. This consolidation has given rise to the renewal of the <span style="color: #385A38;">Green Front</span>, an umbrella group of the RLB, peasant unions, and some Catholic and <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>-affiliated agricultural organizations.
