= The 'Potempa Five' Are Pardoned!

In a bid to win <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> support for his government, Papen and his Justice Minister have bowed to pressure and commuted the murderers' sentences, using his power as Prussia's *Reichskommissar*. The hope is that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> will back Papen in the upcoming confidence vote—but this capitulation has only strengthened the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, laying bare the government's unwillingness—or inability—to confront them.

Yet another disgraceful capitulation to the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. Still, their shameless defense of convicted murderers may alienate voters and cost them dearly at the next election.
