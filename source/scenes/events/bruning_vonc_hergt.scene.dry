= Vote of no confidence

Following the collapse of our coalition, President Hindenburg has appointed Heinrich Brüning of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] in a government supported by bourgeois forces. [? if center_right_coalition < 50: However, they cannot survive without the support from us, considering that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> won't participate. ?]

Brüning, has reorganized his cabinet to include the parties to the right of the [? if not lvp_formed and dvp_exist: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if not lvp_formed and not dvp_exist: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?], such as the <span style="color: #b8996f;">**WP**</span> and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, to create [? if was_in_center_right_coalition == 0:a?][? if was_in_center_right_coalition == 1:another?] center-right coalition. [? if center_right_coalition < 50: We are left with the choice to "tolerate" the government to prevent the gains of extremists within the Reichstag or vote to oust Brüning for new elections. ?]

We have broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, and have voted against them in a vote of no confidence. We also repealed their emergency powers.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

We try to convince the workers that this policy is necessary in order to maintain a stable parliamentary government, and to deal with the fiscal consequences of the depression. Still, this policy provides excellent recruiting fodder for <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.

The right-wing coalition has fallen. New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The bourgeois has survived without our toleration, leaving us as an opposition party.
