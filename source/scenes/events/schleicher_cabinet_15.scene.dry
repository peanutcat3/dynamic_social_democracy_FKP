= Prussian Police Dissolved

Frick, the <span style="color: #6A1E1E;">**DSU**</span>, and Schleicher have been coordinating closely to smooth Germany’s transition into a more authoritarian system. The Prussian police, still riddled with <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> sympathizers, remains a key obstacle—too entrenched to purge outright without crippling the force.

But with the Reichswehr’s militia now patrolling the streets under Frick and Strasser’s oversight, there is no longer any need for this relic of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Republic. In its place, the <i>Staatsschutzamt</i> (State Security Office) has been created, staffed by <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and Schleicher loyalists.

For now, the organization remains confined to Prussia, but its presence is felt everywhere. Local party members whisper that their phones are tapped, and troublesome politicians vanish—never to be seen again. With the police now firmly under government control, they decide which crimes to overlook and coordinate raids hand-in-hand with the Reichswehr.

Yet, their reach still depends on the willingness of people to betray their comrades by reporting them to the police.
