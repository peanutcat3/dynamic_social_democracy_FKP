= Presidential Election campaigning

[? if nsdap_candidate_1932: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, standing alone in the electoral fight to elect [+ nsdap_candidate_1932_disp +], has little chance of winning—at least according to our advisors. However, this does not mean the election is inconsequential. The extensive <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> propaganda campaign, orchestrated by the infamous Joseph Goebbels, combined with the upcoming local elections just a month after the first round, could significantly shift public opinion. This, in turn, may pressure President Hindenburg and his entourage to adopt a more antagonistic stance toward the current government and push for a reorganization of the national government to include the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span>. [? if nsdap_candidate_1932 == "Hitler": Furthermore, Adolf Hitler possesses a remarkable charismatic ability, and his strategy of flying across Germany to deliver speeches to hundreds of thousands of otherwise indifferent voters each day rivals even that of Hindenburg. ?][? if nsdap_candidate_1932 == "Göring": With Hitler ineligible, Hermann Göring has taken up the mantle as the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>'s candidate. As aw staunch figure of the party’s right wing and an opponent of Strasser’s more radical policies, Göring will find it easier to attract industrial support, securing crucial funding for their extensive propaganda network. ?] ?]

[? if spd_support_hindenburg: With our support for President Hindenburg, we are excluded from the United Hindenburg Committees, the main organization promoting his candidacy. Our support is unwelcome by Hindenburg himself, while Westarp and Gereke, the key leaders of the United Hindenburg Committees, will attempt to distance themselves from us as much as possible to secure moderate right-wing and industrial backing. As a result, our role in the campaign will be to rally the German Left, who remain reluctant to vote for a reactionary like him. ?][? if spd_campaign: We are running Otto Braun, one of our most renowned and respected statesmen. His reformist stance has given us a chance to attract some crossover support from the bourgeois parties. However, many outside our party would sooner die than support a <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span>. Our only viable path to expanding our vote share lies in winning back disaffected <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> and mobilizing worker enthusiasm. ?][? if spd_support_thalmann: Our controversial decision to support [+ communist_candidate_1932_disp +] as a leftist unity candidate has deeply polarized German politics, setting the stage for a final showdown between Marxism and Capitalism. A civil war is not even out of the question, regardless of which candidate emerges victorious. With the German Left united behind [+ communist_candidate_1932 +], our electoral base has little room to grow—we can only hope that the workers turn out in full force at the polls. ?]

The finances of the Hindenburg campaign are in disarray. Influential industrialists and business leaders are withholding significant donations due to his perceived betrayal of the Right.

In a meeting with Chancellor Brüning, Defense Minister Groener, General Schleicher, Finance Minister and Vice-Chancellor Hermann Dietrich, and our own Carl Severing, discussions focused on the upcoming presidential election and the organization of an effective propaganda campaign for Hindenburg. Severing outlined the threat that <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>—particularly the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>—posed to state authority and emphasized the election's critical role in keeping the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> in check.

All present agreed that a decisive victory for Hindenburg and a campaign free from violent disturbances would greatly accelerate Germany’s economic recovery and domestic political stabilization. Achieving this, however, would require the use of state funds. Dietrich himself passionately advocated for this, having secretly transferred 1.8 million marks to Severing and the Prussian government with the understanding that the funds would be distributed among various pro-Hindenburg organizations in the State of Prussia. This approach allowed Dietrich and the government to support pro-Hindenburg groups outside the right-wing United Hindenburg Committees.

We argue to our base that, despite Hindenburg's well-known <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> beliefs, he has refrained from outright dismantling our democracy, and supporting him as the lesser evil is necessary. However, our strong campaign in favor of President Hindenburg has discredited him in the eyes of his <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> supporters who initially voted for him in 1925. This has increased Hindenburg's desire to distance himself from our support by shifting further to the right.

Prominent leaders of the Lutheran Church have endorsed President Hindenburg, arguing that despite their historical political neutrality, his reelection is a pressing necessity. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church is even more united in support of Hindenburg than it was for Wilhelm Marx in 1925. Catholic leaders, historically skeptical of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>, have actively discouraged their members from joining <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> paramilitary organizations. This, combined with the strong support of Catholic-affiliated trade unions, will prove enormously significant in rallying a skeptical Catholic population behind a candidate whom most instinctively associate with Lutheran orthodoxy and Prussian authoritarianism.

The United Hindenburg Committees have set to work improving the perception of moderate right-wing German voters toward President Hindenburg, whose reputation as the Hero of Tannenberg has been tarnished by his support for the hated <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> system. Despite this, the <span class="tooltip-text" title="Following Hindenburg's overseeing of Germany's crushing victory at Tannenberg in WW1, Hindenburg has become the center of a massive personality cult, lauded as the living ideal of German masculinity and patriotism. He is the embodiment of the best virtues of Prussian tradition.">Hindenburg Mythos</span> remains intact[? if nsdap_candidate_1932 == "Hitler":, and may be the only thing that rivals Hitler's charisma?].

It's their turn to campaign.

In an attempt to rival the dynamism of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> campaign, the Hindenburg campaign initially tried to convince Graf Zeppelin pilot Hugo Eckener to fly across Germany in support of Hindenburg. However, with Eckener already scheduled for a flight to South America, the campaign had to pivot to an alternative approach. They opted to rent airplanes to drop twenty million leaflets over the German population. However, this isn't enough to counteract the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> style of campaigning.

Carl Duisberg, the chairman of the United Hindenburg Committees have largely been unsuccessful in convincing big business leaders to sign the petition for Hindenburg's reelection, but perhaps the gravity of this race would help convince them?

Duisberg, being the former chairman of the National Federation of German Industry (RDI) and one of the more moderate members, has been successful in soliciting donations from many business leaders who had reservations about backing Hindenburg again. The radical revolutionary and socialistic policies of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> have greatly discouraged them from donating to [+ nsdap_candidate_1932 +]. It now looks like the Hindenburg campaign finally has the resources to properly establish a campaign infrastructure that can rival Goebbels' efforts and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>.

Despite the antipathy the industrialists have toward [? if not hitler_deported: Hitler and the ?]<span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> due to their crypto-<span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> policies, a large part of them are firmly opposed to Hindenburg, and will withhold their donations. The Hindenburg campaign is beginning to heavily fall behind the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> in more rural areas, primarily due to the lack of resources.

Prominent leaders of the Lutheran Church have endorsed President Hindenburg, arguing that despite their historical political neutrality, his reelection is a pressing necessity. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church is even more united in support of Hindenburg than it was for Wilhelm Marx in 1925. Catholic leaders, historically skeptical of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>, have actively discouraged their members from joining <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> paramilitary organizations. This, combined with the strong support of Catholic-affiliated trade unions, will prove enormously significant in rallying a skeptical Catholic population behind a candidate whom most instinctively associate with Lutheran orthodoxy and Prussian authoritarianism.

Despite strong opposition from state and local Protestant church organizations—many of whose members sympathize with [+ nsdap_candidate_1932 +] and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>—they have taken a public stand and will be campaigning in favor of Hindenburg, even amid growing calls for them to withdraw their endorsements.

go-to: bourgeois_campaign_menu_op

Unfortunately for the Hindenburg campaign, the pro-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> sentiment within state and local churches has prevented church leaders from taking a public stand for Hindenburg. Many devout Protestants will now be voting for [+ nsdap_candidate_1932 +] as a result, as the church now claims that intervening in a presidential election would be against its nature.

Of course, the main goal of the United Hindenburg Committees is to dispel the notion that Hindenburg is supported by the <span style="color: #000000;">Black</span>-<span style="color: #c00000;">Red</span> parties. To this end, Westarp has sent a letter to 750 conservative elites who supported Hindenburg's election in 1925, with 500 reaffirming their support of Hindenburg today.
