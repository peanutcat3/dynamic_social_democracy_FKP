= The <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> merges with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>

The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>, having undergone a major transformation into the center-right <span style="color: #000000;">Christian People's Party</span> under Stegerwald, has been flirting with the idea of merging with [+ dnvp_leader +]'s <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> for the past few months. Their mutual participation in the currently governing right-wing coalition, newfound ideological closeness, and shared fears of both the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span>—coupled with their electoral decline at the hands of the former—have pushed them toward closer cooperation.

Following our fallout with the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> over their new direction, our remaining allies within their ranks have been sidelined, leaving them powerless to oppose the proposed merger. This shift has enabled the party’s leadership, alongside newly integrated right-wing Protestant politicians, to open negotiations with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> on a possible unification. However, resistance remains: the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>’s old guard, led by figures like Westarp and Schiele, remain deeply skeptical of the merger, citing fundamental disagreements over key "national questions," such as reparations.

A great deal of concessions are required to bring both sides to a comprehensive agreement, as both parties go through their differences and attempt to design a uniform policy if they were to merge. However, it is likely one party will have the upper hand in negotiations, either due to their electoral advantage, or reluctance forcing more sweeping concessions to be granted.

The reparations issue remains the most contentious point of contention between the two parties, with starkly opposing views on how to handle Germany’s financial obligations. The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, including Treviranus himself, staunchly opposed the Young Plan and has previously clashed with the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> over foreign policy achievements such as the Locarno Treaties in the past.

The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> have used their leverage to edit in their most important goals to the party program.

Reparations - Germany must push for the complete abolition of reparations and the revocation of the "war guilt" clause, but will continue payments in the meantime

The Eastern Policy - Germany should seek to pressure Poland for the return of our former lands, force if necessary later down the line

The Western Policy - Closer ties between Austria and the Reich, push for an *Anschluss*, referendum for Eupen-Malmedy

The Reichswehr - Continue the secret rearmament and refitting of the army

@reparations_moderate

The <span style="color: #000000;">Christians</span> and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> have begrudgingly come to an agreement, as pragmatism wins the day; Germany can't simply refuse to pay.

Reparations - Germany should seek a policy of fulfillment, hoping for a revision of the Versailles treaty

The Eastern Policy - Germany should seek to pressure Poland for the return of our former lands, peacefully later down the line

The Western Policy - Closer ties between Austria and the Reich, referendum for Eupen-Malmedy

The Reichswehr - Continue the secret rearmament and refitting of the army

The <span style="color: #000000;">Christians</span> have used their influence to push for a more restrained and diplomatic foreign policy, aligning with the legacy of Stresemann.

Reparations - Germany should be develop closer ties with the West, hoping for a revision of the Versailles treaty

The Eastern Policy - Germany should seek to peacefully settle disputes in the East

The Western Policy - Closer ties between Austria and the Reich

The Reichswehr - Continue the secret rearmament, but scale it down

The issue of the German <span style="color: #808080;">monarchy</span> remains highly divisive, with both parties holding starkly different views. Despite the unfeasibility of a restoration in the current political climate, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> has never ceased advocating for a return to the days of the <span class="tooltip-text" title="good mod">Kaiserreich</span>. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>, on the other hand, has consistently been a staunch <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> force since the birth of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Republic. Perhaps the influence of the <span style="color: #0087DC;">People's Conservatives</span> will outweigh the strong objections from the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>'s old guard.

The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> and <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarians</span> have successfully pushed for the inclusion of support for a constitutional monarchy in the party platform. However, it is no longer a central pillar of the party's ideology.

Monarchy - Support for a constitutional monarchy, similar to the stance of the[? if not dvp_exist or lvp_formed:&nbsp;former?] <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>.

Democracy - Favoring a strengthened presidency, while maintaining a pro-democratic stance

The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> and <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarians</span> have leveraged their influence to block an outright endorsement of <span style="color: #000000;">repu</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">blica</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">nism</span> in the party platform, ensuring their views remain represented despite being a vocal minority.

The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> and <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarians</span> attempted to insert their long-standing support for monarchism into the party platform, but were decisively outvoted by the staunchly <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, along with support from some <span style="color: #0087DC;">People's Conservatives</span>.

Monarchy – Official endorsement of the <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> system

The <span style="color: #000000;">Christians</span> and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> have begrudgingly come to an agreement, as pragmatism wins the day. The party must represent its diverse base, for the *Volksgemeinschaft*.

Taxation - Avoid tax increases at all costs

Welfare - Focus on funding the current system, as the poor are suffering
