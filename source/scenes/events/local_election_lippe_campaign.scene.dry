= Lippe Landtag Campaigning

Being the only state election between Schleicher's appointment and Strasser’s resignation, which, alongside several local elections, has painted a picture of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi Party</span>'s rapid decline, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> are eager to pour all their resources into a victory in this microstate. The intensity of their campaign is unprecedented, with [+ nsdap_chancellor +] and dozens of nationally prominent <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leaders holding rallies as many as a dozen times per day.

A defeat here would cement the growing belief that the party is collapsing—and deny them a much-needed propaganda victory to revitalize their flagging morale. The local <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> remains strong, having secured 39% of the vote in the last election and winning a majority of the urban vote. Meanwhile, the various bourgeois parties that once dominated the rural areas have become irrelevant and are likely to crumble under the weight of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> campaign.

The odds favor the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>: the near-total absence of Catholics, a 60% rural population, and the fact that this state constitutes just a quarter of a percent of Germany’s population—all make it possible for them to blanket the area with propaganda and demonstrations at minimal cost.

This is a high-stakes campaign: if the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> fail to make a strong showing despite their all-out effort, the consequences will be enormously magnified. Given the state’s tiny size, the real question isn’t whether we can afford to campaign—but how much we’re willing to invest in it.

@schleicher
title: Chancellor Schleicher offers to lend supporting parties state funding.
unavailable-subtitle: And that includes no one at the moment, not even the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">DNVP</span>.

Schleicher, in recognition of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>'s relative support for his cabinet, has granted us access to secret state funding for the campaign. This move is also likely to improve the party's perception of the chancellor.

@campaign_low
title: Leave campaigning to the local <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.
subtitle: This is the default option.
view-if: not schleicher_spd_lippe
on-arrival: campaign_low_lippe = 1

We don't need to worry about Lippe. Local campaigning efforts are left to the historically popular local <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> and Minister-President, who seek to maintain the loyalty of the state's working-class.

Our campaign pales in comparison to the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> one by miles, who have received a welcome surprise by Hugenberg announcing a political truce with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, a step toward reconciliation. Therefore, their campaign has free rein over the rural 60% of the state.

@campaign_med
title: Launch a campaign among the urban sections of Lippe, focusing on the working-class.

Despite Lippe's small size, we must step up our ground game. Speakers are brought in from all over the country to preach to the workers about the dangers of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>, and highlight the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>'s accomplishments on behalf of the working class. [? if democracy_paramilitary: Despite the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>'s attempts at disruption, Reichsbanner units brought in from other parts of the country maintain order. ?][? if not democracy_paramilitary: However, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has repeatedly disrupted our gatherings, and attacked many of our officials. ?]

Our campaign still pales in comparison to the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, who were given a significant boost when Hugenberg announced a political truce with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, marking a step toward reconciliation. As a result, their campaign now has free rein over the rural 60% of the state.

@campaign_high
title: Launch an extensive ground and propaganda campaign, reaching all corners of the state.
subtitle: -2 resources
choose-if: resources >= 2
unavailable-subtitle: Not enough resources.
on-arrival: resources -= 2; spd_lippe += 0.2; nsdap_lippe -= 0.2; spd_lippe -= 0.05 if not democracy_paramilitary; nsdap_lippe += 0.05 if not democracy_paramilitary; spd_lippe -= 0.05 if not peoples_party; nsdap_lippe += 0.05 if not peoples_party

Despite Lippe's small size, our campaign needs to rival the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. Speakers are brought in from all over the country to preach to the workers about the dangers of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>, and highlight the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>'s accomplishments on behalf of the working class. We made efforts to campaign among the traditionally conservative rural areas of the state, [? if not peoples_party: however, we have not historically campaigned much among the farmers, and they do not trust us over the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. ?][? if peoples_party: with varying degrees of success. ?][? if democracy_paramilitary: Despite the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>'s attempts at disruption, Reichsbanner units brought in from other parts of the country maintain order. ?][? if not democracy_paramilitary: However, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has repeatedly disrupted our gatherings, and attacked many of our officials. ?]

Although our campaigning efforts may finally have caught up to the one of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, they've received a welcome surprise by Hugenberg announcing a political truce with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, a step toward reconciliation. As a result, their campaign is free from bourgeois counter-campaigns in the rural 60% of the state.
