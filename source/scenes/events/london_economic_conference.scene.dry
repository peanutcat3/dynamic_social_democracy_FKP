= London Economic Conference

# TODO: if you've recovered, you get economic recovery
# if you haven't recovered, you can either support Roosevelt or support the UK/France

The <span style="color: #10069f;">League</span> of <span style="color: #10069f;">Nations</span> is hosting a conference to discuss the state of the global economy and potential solutions to the ongoing depression. All parties want to reduce tariffs to encourage trade. However, the Western powers are at an impasse; <span style="color: #002654;">France</span> and to a lesser extent <span style="color: #C8102E;">Britain</span> are calling for fixed currency exchange rates, while President Roosevelt of the <span style="color: #B31942;">United</span> <span style="color: #0A3161;">States</span> wants to print new money to stimulate demand, calling for "controlled inflation". The <span style="color: #001489;">Europeans</span> want to reduce their debts to the <span style="color: #B31942;">U</span><span style="color: #0A3161;">S</span>, while <span style="color: #B31942;">Amer</span><span style="color: #0A3161;">ica</span> favors continued full payments.

@economic_recovery

[? if wtb_adopted or budget <= 0: Germany has largely recovered from the crisis, owing in large part to the same sorts of economic policies that Roosevelt is pursuing. ?]
[? if not wtb_adopted and budget > 0: Germany has largely recovered from the crisis, without having to resort to budget deficits or devaluing the currency. ?]

@no_recovery

Germany, like the rest of the world, is still deep in the economic crisis, even if it has appeared to bottom out.

As expected, the conservative German bankers support <span style="color: #C8102E;">Britain</span> and <span style="color: #002654;">France</span>'s plan to stabilize currency exchange rates. In response to the continued support for fixed currency exchange rates and the impasse on debts, the <span style="color: #B31942;">Amer</span><span style="color: #0A3161;">icans</span> pull out of the conference, leaving it with no agreements whatsoever.

[? if unemployed >= 15 : Nevertheless, the world economy is slowly improving due in part to the economic stimulus and more liberal trade policies of the Roosevelt administration. ?]
[? if unemployed < 15 : Nevertheless, the world economy is slowly improving due in part to the economic stimulus and more liberal trade policies of the Roosevelt administration as well as our own economic plan. ?]

We support Roosevelt's plan for controlled inflation, leaving us at odds with the <span style="color: #001489;">European</span> powers. In response to the continued support for fixed currency exchange rates by <span style="color: #002654;">France</span> and <span style="color: #C8102E;">Britain</span> and the impasse on debts, the <span style="color: #B31942;">Amer</span><span style="color: #0A3161;">icans</span> pull out of the conference, leaving it with no agreements whatsoever.

Our position brings us closer to other <span style="color: #001489;">European</span> powers. In response to the continued support for fixed currency exchange rates and the impasse on debts, the <span style="color: #B31942;">Amer</span><span style="color: #0A3161;">icans</span> pull out of the conference, leaving it with no agreements whatsoever.

How should we try to salvage the negotiations?

- @salvage_currency: Try to convince <span style="color: #002654;">France</span> and <span style="color: #C8102E;">Britain</span> that slowly controlled inflation is possible and desirable.
- @salvage_debts: Try to convince the <span style="color: #B31942;">U</span><span style="color: #0A3161;">S</span> to reduce war debts for the sake of peace.
- @no_business: Nothing can be done.

unavailable-subtitle: Wladimir Woytinsky would be extremely helpful right now.
on-arrival: unemployed -= 2 if unemployed >= 10; unemployed -= 1.5 if unemployed >= 5; inflation += 1.5; workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 3*(1-dissent)

Wladimir Woytinsky, now part of our delegation to the conference, uses our successful implementation of the WTB-plan in order to argue for loosening currency valuation. The argument is at least somewhat convincing, and an agreement is reached, leading to increased inflation and demand stimulus throughout the world.

@salvage_debts
choose-if: reparations <= -2 and pacifism >= 3 and (rearmament_exposed or west_relation >= 3)
unavailable-subtitle: We cannot argue for pacifism in our current state.
on-arrival: budget += 1; unemployed -= 1 if unemployed >= 10; unemployed -= 1 if unemployed >= 5; inflation += 1; new_middle_spd += 4*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent)

We try to argue that reducing war debts will reduce the risk of a future <span style="color: #001489;">European</span> war, using our successful disarmament and the reduction in Versailles reparation payments as an argument. The argument is at least somewhat convincing to the <span style="color: #B31942;">Amer</span><span style="color: #0A3161;">icans</span>, leading to an agreement to reduce debts from the Great War. This indirectly also improves our economy.

The conference collapses, as expected. In response to the continued support for fixed currency exchange rates and the impasse on debts, the <span style="color: #B31942;">Amer</span><span style="color: #0A3161;">icans</span> pull out of the conference, leaving it with no agreements whatsoever.
