= Democratic Bulwark Dismantled

We have somehow antagonized the parties involved in the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Coalition ruling over Prussia, and our coalition partners have called a vote of no confidence against us.

The only alternative coalition that can be formed with the current composition of the state parliament is a broad right-wing coalition, ranging from the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> to the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>. [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical" and dnvp_leader != "Westarp": However, this is heavily unlikely with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>'s all-or-nothing stance on governance. ?] Prussia employs a constructive vote of no confidence, meaning that a government can only be removed if a successor can be put forth. This mechanism is how we were able to govern in a minority government in the past.

Finally, the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> can govern alone! Our long campaign of electioneering has paid off. We do not need to worry about coalition government; anything is possible. However, our former coalition partners are going to start drifting to the right.

Braun is selected to be the Minister-President of Prussia.

Hermann Göring is elevated to the position of Minister-President and immediately starts dismantling its democratic institutions.

A wave of terror and repression unfolds, targeting the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>. Violence erupts in the streets, with bullets flying and leftists being killed or imprisoned.

A right coalition is formed, albeit with an extremely narrow majority.

It won't take long for the government to collapse and for us to take power through new elections. But when it eventually does, we won't have much allies as our former coalition partners are beginning to shift to the right. When the time comes, who will stand with us?

Somehow, surprisingly, the left coalition is successfully formed, without appointing a <span style="color: #700000;">communist</span> as Minister-President.

In response to the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>'s entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that our government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, eventually enabling the destruction of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Republic.
