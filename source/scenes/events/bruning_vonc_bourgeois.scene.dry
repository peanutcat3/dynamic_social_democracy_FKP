= actually what the hell

Following the collapse of the Grand coalition, President Hindenburg has appointed Heinrich Brüning of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> Party in a government supported solely by bourgeois forces. Usually, these governments can't survive without toleration from the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> or the inclusion of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>. 

Somehow, a bourgeois coalition actually holds a majority in the Reichstag, consisting of the plethora of parties between the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.
