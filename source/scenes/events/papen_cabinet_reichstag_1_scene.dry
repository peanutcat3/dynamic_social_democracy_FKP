= Reichstag Reconvenes

The Reichstag has reconvened for the first time since the election, with a significantly larger contingent of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> members now present. The immediate issue at hand is the election of the President of the Reichstag. While the position has traditionally been a procedural one, it has taken on heightened importance under Papen's presidential government, given the President's authority to influence the agenda and adjourn sessions.

By long-standing custom, the role is granted to the largest parliamentary delegation (as long as it isn't the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>). That delegation is now the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> holds the balance of power. Will they uphold tradition and hand a key parliamentary post to an openly anti-constitutional party?

With negotiations between the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> underway, previously hostile relations have thawed enough for the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> to support Hermann Göring’s election as President of the Reichstag. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> delegation’s newfound decorum convinced many that the party had turned over a new leaf.

In line with a promise made to the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>, the Reichstag has adjourned for two more weeks to allow coalition talks to take place. Yet unease is growing within the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> at the possibility of a [+ nsdap_chancellor +] chancellorship, and they may soon walk away from the table.
