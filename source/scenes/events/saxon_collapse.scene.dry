= Collapse of the Saxon Cabinet

The Bünger Cabinet's days are numbered following a dispute over the Saxon Reichsrat delegation's support for the Young Plan, which has led to a loss of confidence from the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, <span style="color: #11DD11;">**SLV**</span>, and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>.

We can either exit the opposition and prop up the cabinet to avoid new elections, or maintain our role in opposition-supporting all votes of no confidences.

Surprisingly, despite reluctance on both sides due to fears that the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> Hindenburg will order a *Reichsexekution* if a coalition were to form. <span style="color: #c00000;">Red</span> Saxony is restored! 

As one of the most left-wing and industrial states in Germany, we will use our leverage to implement comprehensive reforms and transform Saxony into a stronghold of <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>. Hindenburg’s patience is especially thin. Tread carefully.

As expected, the bourgeois government in Saxony isn't able to survive the vote of no confidence. New elections are called for June, but the Bünger Cabinet continues to operate as a caretaker government.

This grants an opportunity for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> to exploit and capitalize on political instability and the perceived failure of parliamentary democracy.
