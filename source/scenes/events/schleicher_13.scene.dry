= <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> joins the <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span>

With the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> effectively dead as a political force, many former politicians—especially on its right wing—have long advocated for its self-dissolution, believing only then could a new, unified force rise from its ashes.

That belief has only strengthened with the rise of the <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span>. Now, more party members are calling for a formal merger into Schleicher's organization. His appeals to national unity have struck a psychological blow to the rank and file of a party that always championed the welfare and unity of the nation as a whole above all.

Old-line <span style="color: #D3C24D;">democrats</span> like Dietrich and Heuss remain the most resistant, committed <span style="color: #000000;">repu</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">bli</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">cans</span> to the core. But figures like Lemmer and the party’s left wing are proving more susceptible to Schleicher’s calls for national unity.

Nonetheless, a vote is conducted, and the opposition wins.
