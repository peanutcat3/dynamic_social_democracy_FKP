= Weimar Constitution Referendum

After months of campaigning and propaganda by both sides, the German people have come to vote on the referendum for the revision of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Constitution, which has taken the backseat in comparison to the devastating economic depression. 

Passing the referendum would need to require the approval of more than 50% of those eligible to vote, rather than a majority of those that do vote [? if (dvp_relation_9 >= 40 and dvp_ideology_9 != "Right" and not lvp_formed) or ((lvp_ideology_9 != "Right" or lvp_relation_9 >= 40) and lvp_formed): This makes it impossible for the referendum to succeed, even with the recent economic depression?][? if (dvp_relation_9 < 40 and dvp_ideology_9 != "Left" and not lvp_formed) or ((lvp_ideology_9 == "Right" and lvp_relation_9 < 40) and lvp_formed): This has made it difficult for the referendum to succeed, however with the support of the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] and <span style="color: #A2D8E0;">**BVP**</span> has made it a distant possibility, with the recent economic depression?]. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #003755;">right</span> parties are also abstaining from supporting this referendum.

The referendum fails, with only around [+ weimar_ref_votes +]% of voters participating in it. It seems that the right is far more divided now than they were in supporting President Hindenburg four years ago. [? if weimar_ref_votes >= 40: However, the support for the referendum is higher than expected. ?][? if weimar_ref_votes < 30: The support for the referendum was lower than expected, this should weaken the right-wing parties. ?] The goal behind the referendum was not for it to succeed, but to rally the right-wing parties[? if (dvp_relation_9 >= 40 and dvp_ideology_9 != "Right" and not lvp_formed) or ((lvp_ideology_9 != "Right" or lvp_relation_9 >= 40) and lvp_formed):, which has failed since they've failed to recruit the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] [? if not lvp_formed: and <span style="color: #A2D8E0;">**BVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: and [? if not cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]?]?].

[? if weimar_ref_votes >= 50: report to the dev if you got this, this shouldn't be possible. ?]
