= Suspension of the Austrian Parliament

Due to a controversial proposal regarding a railroad strike in the Austrian National Council, all three presidents of the National Council resigned, leaving it without any presiding officers. This is a constitutional crisis. Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß has taken advantage of this crisis by suspending the parliament and ruling by emergency decree, forming an "<span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascist</span>" government. Dollfuß consolidates his power by persecuting his political opponents, especially our fellow <span style="color: #A50034;">Social Democrats</span> in the <span style="color: #A50034;">**SDAPÖ**</span> (<span style="color: #A50034;">Social Democratic Worker's Party of Austria</span>).

Is there anything we could do?

# - use EU to sanction Austria (will prevent civil war and restore democracy)
# - apply diplomatic pressure to Austria (without EU)
# - fund the Schutzbund
# after this, supporting Austrians will raise sdapo_strength; if sdapo_strength >= 2, they'll enter a long civil war; if sdapo_strength >= 5, they'll win.

- @eu_sanctions: Call upon the <span style="color: #001489;">European</span> <span style="color: #FFDD00;">Union</span> to sanction Austria, unless the National Council is restored.
- @diplomatic_pressure: Apply diplomatic pressure to Austria to restore the National Council.
- @fund_schutzbund: Support the <span style="color: #A50034;">**SDAPÖ**</span>'s underground organizing.
- @nothing: Nothing can be done.

@eu_sanctions
view-if: eu = 1
on-arrival: sdapo_strength += 3; sdapo_strength += 1 if customs_union; eu_austria = 1

The <span style="color: #001489;">European</span> <span style="color: #FFDD00;">Union</span> is a largely untested body, and from the beginning contained members that are at best quasi-democratic. Most of its members are more concerned by power politics than democratic values. However, as its founder, Germany holds a special influence in the <span style="color: #001489;">E</span><span style="color: #FFDD00;">U</span>, and we manage to persuade the other members to join in the pressure against <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascism</span>.

The Dollfuß regime does not give in, but it is weakened and isolated.

@diplomatic_pressure
view-if: foreign_minister_party = "SPD"
on-arrival: sdapo_strength += 1; sdapo_strength += 2 if customs_union

We still have much economic influence in Austria, and the threat of sanctions.

The Dollfuß regime does not give in, but it is somewhat weakened.

@fund_schutzbund
on-arrival: resources -= 1; sdapo_strength += 1; sdapo_strength += 1 if customs_union
subtitle: -1 resource
choose-if: resources >= 1

It is somewhat of a breach of diplomatic protocol for the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> to so directly interfere in another country's affairs, supporting the <span style="color: #A50034;">Austrian social democrats</span>.

The Dollfuß regime does not give in, but its opponents have an added advantage. That may not be enough when dealing with the total force of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascist</span> state.

@nothing

Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do for our Austrian comrades.
