= <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> Party Conference

Now is the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>'s national party conference, where they will choose their new leadership. The shadow of the Wittorf Affair hangs over it. On one hand are the hardline supporters of Thälmann, who support a "<span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>" policy that places the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> as equivalent to the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. On the other hand is the "Conciliator" faction, who support a more cooperative policy towards the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

After our discussion with the <span style="color: #940000;">Soviets</span>, we are inclined to believe that <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalin</span> is at least open to the Conciliators. In order to affect the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>'s leadership elections, we have to influence both the <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span> leaders as as well as the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> membership.

With our support, the Conciliators have won the leadership contest! The new leadership is a group of Conciliators, including Arthur Ewert, Hugo Eberlein, and Ernst Meyer. But who should lead the KPD from here on out?

- @ewert
- @meyer

title: Thälmann retains his leadership position.

Unfortunately, we could not influence the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> leadership election against the hardliners. Thälmann quickly moves to consolidate absolute leadership, expelling or exiling his opponents.
