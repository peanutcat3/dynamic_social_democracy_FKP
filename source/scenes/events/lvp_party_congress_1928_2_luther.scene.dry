= <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> Party Congress

With Luther elected president, he naturally cannot continue serving as the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>'s chairman. A party congress is convened to select his successor. This marks the first time Germany has elected a president from the political middle, and optimism within the party is running high.

The candidates in the running belong to the younger generation, as the party looks to carry forward the momentum gained from Luther’s presidential victory.

Theodor Heuss, a rising star and former member of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, has been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">Liberal People's Party</span>. Backed primarily by the 'Social Republican Circle,' composed of former <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> members and liberal intellectuals and newspapers, Heuss has also garnered support from the broader party due to his decently conservative stances on economic and national issues.

Heuss's victory empowers the '<span style="color: #c00000;">Social</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span>' wing, strengthening our cooperation. Despite his personal leanings toward the right, Heuss remains one of the most committed and genuine supporters for <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberal</span> <span style="color: #586593;">democracy</span> within the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>.

face-image: img/portraits/maier.jpg

Reinhold Maier, a major figure in Württemberg politics and a rising star in the struggling party, has been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Youthful and energetic, he is less bound by dogma than many veteran members, making him a strong choice for a party plagued by defeatism and internal strife.

His association with the former <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s business wing isn't the best news for future cooperation. While still an improvement over Luther’s policies, it is only a slight one.

@dieckmann

(If you can find an image of him taken around this period of time, please message the modman.)

Johannes Dieckmann, a relatively minor figure who only recently became president of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>'s parliamentary group in the Saxon Landtag, has been elected party chairman. A longtime associate of Stresemann and a member of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s left wing, Dieckmann even chaired a revolutionary soldiers' council in 1918.

His youth and low profile have left him with few enemies—unlike Curtius—making him a palatable compromise. While he represents an improvement over Luther’s policies, it is a slight one.

@dingeldey
title: Eduard Dingeldey is elected.
subtitle: Dingeldey was a member of the former <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, and commonly associated with the industrial-right of the party.
unavailable-subtitle: The right-industrial faction of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">LVP</span> lack the power necessary to install their candidate.
choose-if: dingeldey_lead

face-image: img/portraits/dingeldey.jpg

Eduard Dingeldey, previously part of the movement for bourgeois unity, has now been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Dingeldey is backed by the industrial forces on the right of the party, alongside former <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> members. He appears to be focused on fostering closer cooperation with the array of parties between the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.

However, Dingeldey has thus far proven to be an ineffectual leader, often capitulating to the right wing of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Recently, we’ve observed a deterioration in relations with his party, alongside a noticeable rightward shift in the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>'s internal politics.

The vote has been deadlocked, with no candidate ahead by enough to constitute a majority. You, the player, now has free will to choose a compromise candidate. Spend it wisely.
