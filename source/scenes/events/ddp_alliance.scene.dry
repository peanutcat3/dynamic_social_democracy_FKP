= The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s Proposal

Due to the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s declining electoral performance, threatening to wipe out their Reichstag delegation come next election, many within their party like the retired Koch-Weser have been lobbying for a technical list connection with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

Despite their electoral standing, many within their business wing like Theodor Heuss argue that allying with the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> would be detrimental to their stance of economic freedom, while many on their left wing such as Ernst Lemmer argue it's a necessity in order to save their party and democracy. We can either offer to help the dying party out, increasing their parliamentary presence, or leave them on their own.

After their internal vote, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> accepts our offer, despite the opposition from whatever remains of the business wing. The party suffers electorally from their association with us, even if many right-wingers stress it as nothing more than a technical list connection. Anyhow, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> will receive more parliamentary seats now.

[? if ddp_ideology == "Left" and ddp_leader == "Lemmer": Lemmer has decided to take things a step further, and has further increased electoral cooperation between our parties. Perhaps this alliance will last more than just one election? ?]

Unfortunately, despite our offer for help, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> has rejected the list connection in an internal vote. Even in the state they're in currently, they still adamantly oppose any association with <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>. Maybe they'll change their mind when the election results come through.
