= Schleicher and [+ nsdap_leader +]

In a meeting at the Defense Ministry following Schleicher's resignation, one general proposed resorting to force to prevent a Papen cabinet. Schleicher, however, strongly rejected defying the president, with his military training ruling out any such insubordination: “I am a general, Hindenburg is field marshal. I have been taught obedience.”

Nonetheless, Schleicher set up a meeting between his confidants, General Kurt von Hammerstein, and [+ nsdap_leader +], offering the military’s support on behalf of his candidacy for the chancellorship. He also inquired about whether he could stay on as Defense Minister. Keeping his options open, [+ nsdap_leader +] agreed to keep Schleicher as minister and lied about the current state of progress with negotiations.

The day after, Schleicher sent a conservative with <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> connections to extract more details from [+ nsdap_leader +]. Unfortunately for Schleicher, the person he sent boasted that the army command stood ready to intervene if a new cabinet didn't conform to its wishes. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leaders became fearful of a possible military putsch aimed at thwarting [+ nsdap_chancellor +]'s appointment.

Talk of a putsch quickly gave rise to a rapidly spreading, but unfounded rumor that Schleicher planned to depose Hindenburg and take the presidency for himself. Through Meissner and Papen, the news reached Hindenburg, giving a sense of urgency to replace Schleicher.

- @schleicher_3: An unfortunate series of events.
