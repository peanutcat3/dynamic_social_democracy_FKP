= Papen's Scheme Reaches a Dead End

Despite Oskar and Meissner’s willingness to entertain Papen’s schemes to end the political deadlock, Schleicher’s strengthened position has made it harder to instill a sense of urgency in Hindenburg—at least enough to convince him to do the impossible. Papen, meanwhile, refuses to abandon his demand for the chancellorship, arguing that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> are quickly collapsing and that he, not they, should be the senior partner.

A furious [+ nsdap_leader +] has rejected Papen’s call for a meeting between his movement and the Camarilla, and negotiations have since collapsed. Although Papen’s desire for revenge against Schleicher remains undimmed, he increasingly sees [+ nsdap_chancellor +]’s appointment as impossible—and himself as the only viable alternative. A belief that [+ nsdap_leader +] refuses to believe in.

on-arrival: papen_goal = "Push for his own reappointment"; meissner_goal = "Reconcile Schleicher and Hindenburg"; oskar_goal = "Push for Papen's reappointment"; papen_strength -= 1; hindenburg_schleicher_r += 1

Papen's constant nagging remains a thorn in Schleicher's side, especially given that the former chancellor lives just meters from the President's residence—and with Oskar von Hindenburg continuing to influence his father.

Meissner, however, has come to a realization: Schleicher is here to stay. He is not driven by ideology—having served under Ebert beforehand; he was simply trying to do what he believed was best for the nation—an aim that now means supporting Schleicher and his policies.
