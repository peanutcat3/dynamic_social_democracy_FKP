= The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> breaks with Brüning

The sharp rise of the <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> in local elections has triggered mass panic within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, as pessimism and a noticeable shift away from democracy rapidly take hold within the once-constructive "democratic" party. They now believe that only closer cooperation with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #003755;">opposition</span> and a rightward shift in alignment with the nation can salvage their declining poll numbers.

Their first step toward this goal is an attempt to bring down the Brüning government with the assistance of the anti-democratic parties, hoping either to force Brüning into reorganizing his cabinet or to trigger elections that could deliver a right-wing majority. However, Hugenberg and Hitler remain committed to their all-or-nothing strategy, demanding the chancellorship outright from Brüning. This leaves only the prospect of fresh elections as a possibility, with Hitler being very vague about what his government would look like. Given that Hugenberg and Hitler are far from the most trustworthy figures, the party remains in limbo for now.

Hopefully [+ dnvp_leader +] can restore order within his party, and prevent new elections from delivering catastrophic gains for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #003755;">right</span>.

Oskar Hergt, who was once forced to resign nearly a decade ago over his decision to allow a free vote on the Dawes Plan—the very plan that rescued Germany from hyperinflation and ushered in the <span style="color: #FFDF00;">Golden Twenties</span>—is now tendering his resignation once again after failing to impose party discipline.

History seems to be repeating itself: the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> is once again deeply divided, with its pragmatic wing supporting Brüning while its emboldened right wing aligns with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #003755;">opposition</span>.

Gottfried Treviranus, a strong supporter of Brüning and, to some extent, democracy, has enforced party discipline to ensure the Reichstag delegation votes in favor of Brüning. However, despite his efforts to democratize the party, many defy his orders and vote against Brüning's government.
