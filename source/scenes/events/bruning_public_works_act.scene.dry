= Public Works Mobilization Act

With Brüning focused on securing a foreign policy victory, the [? if z_party_name != "CVP":<span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP":<span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]'s Labor Minister Adam Stegerwald and the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?]'s Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Hermann Dietrich have been developing a job creation program. The <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Socialists</span> and several <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> figures, such as Günther Gereke, have also backed this approach. However, given the state of the national budget, such a program was not feasible without either severe welfare cuts or a breakthrough on reparations—delaying action until now due to fears of public backlash.

Dietrich has since secured Reichstag approval to raise 1.4 billion Reichsmarks through a bond issue to fund the initiative. Yet the Reichsbank remains reluctant to provide support, at least not until the reparations issue is resolved at Lausanne in the coming months. As a result, Dietrich’s proposal has been sharply scaled back, with only 160 million Reichsmarks allocated and further austerity measures introduced in the upcoming act. The act’s centerpiece is the establishment of a new "Voluntary Labor Service" brigade, tasked with draining swamps and digging artificial lakes—at subminimum wages.

Should Lausanne bring success, full funding for Dietrich’s program may still follow. Brüning's coalition just has to survive until then.

With strong support from the [? if z_party_name != "CVP":<span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP":<span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?], General Kurt von Schleicher, and his allies in the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, the bill passes. However, it has provoked the anger of industrialists within the center-right coalition—though the scaled-down scope of the plan has, for now, kept their outrage contained.
