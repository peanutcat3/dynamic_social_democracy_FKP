= Vote of No Confidence

The Reichstag has reconvened after its brief adjournment, prepared to address the issue of the Papen cabinet. Von Papen has lost all hope of gaining the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>'s toleration, especially after their stubborn insistence on making [+ nsdap_chancellor +] chancellor. All parties, except for the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>[? if dvp_exist and not lvp_formed:&nbsp;and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?], have made their opposition to Papen clear, making his dismissal nearly certain.

Yet, von Papen holds a card up his sleeve. Hindenburg has already secured a decree allowing him to suspend elections beyond the constitutionally mandated 60 days. All he needs now is to present it to the Reichstag before the vote of no confidence begins.

As expected, the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> have secured unanimous approval for a change in the order of business to allow an immediate vote on a motion of no confidence against Papen, and not even the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> was willing to lift a finger to prevent this. 

With no objection, the vote was to begin just as Chancellor von Papen has arrived inside the Reichstag to present his emergency decree to the chamber, disrupting his plans to present both decrees at once. He had placed the folder on Reichstag President [? if reichstag_president == "Göring": Hermann Göring?][? if reichstag_president == "Löbe": Paul Löbe?][? if reichstag_president == "Eßer": Thomas Eßer?]'s desk, and demanded him to read it to the floor. However, [+ reichstag_president +] has trick up his sleeve: he could pretend he didn't see it and proceed with the no confidence motion anyway.

In the end, Papen is defeated by a humiliating margin with [+ anti_papen_votes +]% of the Reichstag voting against him, only supported by the [? if dnvp_papen or dnvp_ideology == "Radical": <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if (dnvp_ideology == "Moderate" and dnvp_papen) or kvp_papen:, ?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate":<span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span>?][? if kvp_papen: <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>?][? if hugenberg_dvp:&nbsp;and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?]. They're expected to benefit from disillusioned conservative <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> voters, who had backed them under the impression they would support the Papen cabinet.

Before the vote was to begin, Chancellor von Papen has arrived inside the Reichstag to present his emergency decree to the chamber, one to dissolve it and one to postpone future elections. He had placed the folder on Reichstag President [? if reichstag_president == "Göring": Hermann Göring?][? if reichstag_president == "Löbe": Paul Löbe?][? if reichstag_president == "Eßer": Thomas Eßer?]'s desk, who read it to the floor. The chamber erupted in uproar, prompting police on standby to detain numerous Reichstag members involved in the violence, primarily from the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.

News has quickly spread, and Papen has only narrowly escaped from the area before violent mobs assembled all across Berlin were formed to protest the violation of the constitution. Brüning and the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> vow to impeach President Hindenburg, if the Reichstag ever convenes. Germany's in for a violent civil war, and Papen shows no sign of backing down.

With the vulnerability and widespread opposition to the Papen cabinet now fully exposed in parliament, Schleicher’s plan for Papen to sign the decree postponing elections indefinitely has been put on hold. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has also threatened to impeach Hindenburg should he proceed with such an action.

The time is not yet right for the government to openly violate the constitution, and doing so could spark a civil war. The Reichswehr would not be able to withstand the opposition of 90% of the nation.

A minor constitutional crisis erupts when Reichstag President [+ reichstag_president +] disputes the validity of Papen's dissolution decree. [+ reichstag_president +] argues that the Reichstag remains in session, contending that the decree is invalid as it was countersigned by a government that had just been overthrown by a vote of no confidence. [+ reichstag_president +] ultimately concedes the issue before the courts were to decide, and new Reichstag elections are scheduled for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +], Week [+ next_election_week +].
