= Constitutional Coalition

Treviranus, having failed to win over the <span style="color: #6A1E1E;">**DSU**</span>, has now turned to us for support. We find ourselves in the role of kingmaker, while the Chancellor grows increasingly desperate to piece together a parliamentary majority—the only way to avoid being dismissed by Hindenburg for failing to deliver on the President’s central demand.

But perhaps we can bypass this deadlock by targeting Hindenburg himself. With a two-thirds majority in the Reichstag, we could initiate impeachment proceedings under Article 59 or trigger a recall election under Article 43. If the recall election were to fail, the Reichstag would be dissolved for new elections.

Yet the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> nature of the courts renders impeachment unlikely to succeed. Recall, however, remains a narrow possibility—it requires only a majority of those who vote, not of all eligible voters. Still, to make either path viable, we must secure the backing of other parties.

[+ impeachment_votes +]% of the Reichstag has voted to recall President Hindenburg! But our fight is not over yet. A popular referendum is scheduled exactly one month from now to confirm the Reichstag’s decision.

If the referendum succeeds, a new presidential election will be held to determine Hindenburg’s successor. But if it fails, the constitution mandates that the Reichstag be dissolved and fresh elections called once again.

The referendum is scheduled for [+ impeachment_ref_month : month +] [+ impeachment_ref_year +], Week [+ impeachment_ref_week +].

Under the influence of Franz von Papen—and apparently Schleicher as well—Hindenburg has appointed Wilhelm III, eldest son of the last German Emperor, as Chancellor, reportedly with his father’s blessing.

It is clear the chaos of the past year has taken its toll. In the end, Hindenburg now trusts no one but his dearest friend, Papen. It's unknown of the former chancellor's reasoning behind such a pick, but perhaps he would've hoped that reinstating a monarchy, the people can rally around him as they once rallied around Hindenburg. 

A bloody three-way civil war is evitable.

Hindenburg is furious at what he sees as Treviranus’s betrayal—that he would even consider working with the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span>. After much deliberation, the President moves decisively: Treviranus is sacked, and a new successor is chosen under Papen’s influence.
