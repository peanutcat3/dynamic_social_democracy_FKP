= <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> Congress

The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> has suffered severe internal conflicts the past year over Hugenberg's leadership, the Young Plan referendum with its controversial "imprisonment" paragraph, the resignation of Westarp in protest[? if young_plan_signatures >= 10:, the impending vote on it within the Reichstag ?], and the expulsion of their Reichstag member Gottfried Treviranus over a private letter suggesting a split within the party if Hugenberg is unable to be removed. [? if stegerwald_path: Furthermore, the expansion of the [? if not cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] to Protestant voters has eroded its traditional voter base, raising serious doubts about the party's future. ?]

The "unity of the no" against <span style="color: #9B0000;">Marxism</span> has been losing its force over the years, and the referendum against the Young Plan has only exacerbated internal party tensions. Despite Hugenberg's efforts to increase control over the party, Westarp's resignation has set off a flurry of opposition within the party. [? if young_plan_signatures < 10: The failure of the initiative against the Young Plan has strengthened the dissidents position. ?][? if young_plan_signatures >= 10: The success of the initiative against the Young Plan to gather enough signatures has thrown a wrench in the dissident's plans. ?][? if was_in_right_coalition == 1: Many party members voice their dissatisfaction on Hugenberg's withdrawal from the government some time ago.?]

[? if young_plan_signatures < 10: The failure of the Young Plan referendum to reach the 10% threshold?][? if young_plan_signatures < 10 and was_in_right_coalition:&nbsp;and?] [? if was_in_right_coalition: Hugenberg's unpopular decision to exit the right-wing coalition exactly a year from now?] and the declining popularity of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> has convinced the majority of the party to vote out Hugenberg, replacing him with Treviranus, a member of the "Young Conservative" wing of the party. The Young Conservatives are in favor of governmental participation, advancing their goals in the framework of the system. However, the national conservatives retain heavy control over the party and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> isn't exactly a democratic party yet. [? if stegerwald_path: This leaves the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> as a more nationalistic, conservative alternative to the [? if not cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]. ?]

In response, Hugenberg threatens to take himself and his supporters into a new splinter party, which is unlikely to gain much support, considering he remains deeply unpopular beyond his loyal following.

The moderates within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> united under Westarp are unable to defeat Hugenberg in a vote. This is in part due to Hugenberg's efforts of consolidating power within the party organizations. The <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarian</span> representatives in the party finally had enough with Hugenberg's "all or nothing" strategy, especially after he governed as de-facto party dictator, disregarding even those he has shared power with.

The anti-Hugenberg forces within the party have all left to form a new <i>Konservative Volkspartei</i> (Conservative People's Party). It is a question of how long this party would last, with some members rather wanting to affiliate with the special interest parties. Hugenberg is left with a diminished <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, smaller than the faction that split from it.

The moderates within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, joined by the <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarian</span> wing, are unable to defeat Hugenberg in a vote. This is in part due to Hugenberg's efforts of consolidating power within the party organizations. The <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarian</span> representatives in the party finally had enough with Hugenberg's "all or nothing" strategy, especially [? if was_in_right_coalition: after he collapsed the right-wing coalition exactly a year ago[? if (tariffs < 0 or land_reform > 0): leaving them powerless to combat the land and tariff reforms we've enacted?]. ?][? if (tariffs < 0 or land_reform > 0) and not was_in_right_coalition and not dvp_reform: since they're left powerless to combat the land and tariff reforms enacted. ?][? if not (tariffs < 0 or land_reform > 0) and not was_in_right_coalition and dvp_reform: since the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> has been eating into their voter base the past few months. ?][? if (tariffs < 0 or land_reform > 0) and not was_in_right_coalition and dvp_reform: since they're left powerless to combat the land and tariff reforms enacted. ?]

The anti-Hugenberg forces within the party have all left in separate ways. Committed <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> form a new <i>Konservative Volkspartei</i> (Conservative People's Party), while more pragmatic members and trade unionists choose to join the [? if not cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?]. It is a question of how long this party would last, since it finds itself in the small political base to the right of the [? if not cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?], but to the left of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.
