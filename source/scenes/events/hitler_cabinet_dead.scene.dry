= [+ chancellor +] is Sacked

The newly elected president, [+ president +], holds little sympathy for [+ chancellor +] or his party, and has compelled his resignation as Chancellor. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, however, refuses to yield—denouncing the move as “anti-democratic,” insisting that [+ chancellor +] is still the head of government, and openly threatening armed resistance.

What are we to do now?

- @fight: We will fight on the streets to prevent Hitler from retaining power.
- @give_up: We will vote against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> in the Reichstag.

@fight

Do we realize that this means civil war, against the full force of the state?

- @civil_war: Yes.
- @give_up: We are not ready for war. Instead, we will vote against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> in the Reichstag.

go-to: give_up_1 if president_ideology != "Left" or reichswehr_loyalty > 0.2; give_up_2 if (president_ideology == "Left" and reichswehr_loyalty <= 0.2)

The President is on our side, but the Reichswehr remains divided.

Still, they place more trust in [+ president +] than in Chancellor [+ chancellor +], and under this influence, [+ chancellor +] was forced to accept his defeat. His removal, along with the replacement of many <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> cabinet ministers, has stopped Germany's slippery slope into dictatorship.

The next elections are set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

@give_up_2

Unfortunately, the President’s left-wing leanings make him an unacceptable figure to the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> strongholds of the state. The Reichswehr refuses to take his side over that of [+ chancellor +]. Despite holding the highest office in the land, the President finds himself powerless, outmaneuvered by [+ chancellor +].

Eventually, he is ousted through legally questionable means, and new elections are held under the watchful eye of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> troopers—securing Hitler’s rise to absolute power.

Germany is lost.

- @game_over: Game over.
