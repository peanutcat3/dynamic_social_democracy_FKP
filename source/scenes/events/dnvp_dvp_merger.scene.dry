= <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> merges with the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>

The electoral decline of the bourgeois right, the significant shift of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> toward the right, and their shared fear of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> have compelled the two parties to unite. The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, as the larger party, will absorb the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, making key concessions to facilitate the merger.

Internal reactions within the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> are mixed. The Stresemannites and left wing vehemently oppose the merger, while the right-industrial faction supports it as a necessary step. Within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, opposition comes from its <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarian</span> and <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Socialist</span> factions, who resist unification with the industrial-capitalist <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>. Additionally, the party’s old guard, led by Westarp, remains skeptical due to major differences on the "national questions".

- @dnvp_dvp: Regardless, an agreement has been reached.

Many on the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s left, such as Luther and Curtius, along with their supporters, have defected to the flourishing <span style="color: #D3C24D;">[+ ddp_name +]</span>, seeing it as the last bastion of liberalism.

If Stresemann were alive, he would be quite disappointed in what has become of his party.
