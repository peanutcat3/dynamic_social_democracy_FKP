= Presidential Election campaigning

[? if nsdap_candidate_1932: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, standing alone in the electoral fight to elect [+ nsdap_candidate_1932_disp +], has little chance of winning—at least according to our advisors. However, this does not mean the election is inconsequential. The extensive <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> propaganda campaign, orchestrated by the infamous Joseph Goebbels, combined with the upcoming local elections just a month after the first round, could significantly shift public opinion. This, in turn, may pressure President Hindenburg and his entourage to adopt a more antagonistic stance toward the current government and push for a reorganization of the national government to include the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span>. [? if nsdap_candidate_1932 == "Hitler": Furthermore, Adolf Hitler possesses a remarkable charismatic ability, and his strategy of flying across Germany to deliver speeches to hundreds of thousands of otherwise indifferent voters each day rivals even that of Hindenburg. ?][? if nsdap_candidate_1932 == "Göring": With Hitler ineligible, Hermann Göring has taken up the mantle as the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>'s candidate. As aw staunch figure of the party’s right wing and an opponent of Strasser’s more radical policies, Göring will find it easier to attract industrial support, securing crucial funding for their extensive propaganda network. ?] ?]

[? if spd_support_reactionary: With our support for [+ spd_choice +], we are excluded from their campaign committees. Our support is unwelcome by [+ spd_choice +] himself, and he will attempt to distance themselves from us as much as possible to secure moderate right-wing and industrial backing. As a result, our role in the campaign will be to rally the German Left, who remain reluctant to vote for a conservative like him. ?][? if braun_campaign: We are running Otto Braun, one of our most renowned and respected statesmen. His reformist stance has given us a chance to attract some crossover support from the bourgeois parties. However, many outside our party would sooner die than support a <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span>. Our only viable path to expanding our vote share lies in winning back disaffected <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> and mobilizing worker enthusiasm. ?][? if spd_support_thalmann: Our controversial decision to support [+ communist_candidate_1932_disp +] as a leftist unity candidate has deeply polarized German politics, setting the stage for a final showdown between <span style="color: #9B0000;">Marxist</span> and Capitalism. A civil war is not even out of the question, regardless of which candidate emerges victorious. With the German Left united behind [+ communist_candidate_1932 +], our electoral base has little room to grow—we can only hope that the workers turn out in full force at the polls. ?][? if rosenfeld_campaign: We are running Kurt Rosenfeld, a lesser-known figure from our left wing. His leftist stances have given us a chance to attract the support of the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>, but have completely closed the door to support from the bourgeois parties. Our only viable path to expanding our vote share lies in winning back disaffected workers, mobilizing their enthusiasm, and persuading our more reformist middle-class and rural elements to stick with the plan. ?][? if eckener_campaign: We are running Hugo Eckener, a famed non-partisan Zeppelin captain and personally conservative figure. His rightist stances have left the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> vulnerable to defections to the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>, but have completely opened the door to unified support from the bourgeois parties. We can either shore up support for Eckener within the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> itself, or focus on maximizing crossover support and strengthening our cooperation with bourgeois allies. ?]
