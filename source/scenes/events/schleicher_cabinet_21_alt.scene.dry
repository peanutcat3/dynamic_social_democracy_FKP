= The Reichstag Reconvenes

With Hindenburg making it clear that he expects a parliamentary cabinet from Treviranus, the Chancellor has moved to significantly broaden the governing coalition—reaching well to the left. The biggest surprise is the return of Brüning as Foreign Minister.

Though Treviranus and his allies are interested in taming the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, the <span style="color: #6A1E1E;">**DSU**</span> has no interest in becoming a junior partner in a partisan conservative government.

Treviranus inaugurated his new cabinet within the last week, drawing ministers from the <span style="color: #fe9e00;">**ASPD**</span> on the left to his own party on the right. Still, this patchwork coalition is unlikely to command a majority—and a vote of no confidence looms.

As expected, Treviranus isn't able to conjure up a majority without the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> or <span style="color: #6A1E1E;">**DSU**</span>. His government remains a caretaker for the time being.

New Reichstag elections are scheduled for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +], Week [+ next_election_week +].
