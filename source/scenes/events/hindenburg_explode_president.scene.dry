An era of history is closing, and the future remains to be seen.

- @candidates: Who are the candidates so far?

@candidates
go-to: candidate_menu

The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> and Chancellor [+ chancellor +] have chosen to nominate Hans von Seeckt—former Chief of the German Army from 1920 to 1926, and a staunch conservative monarchist, infamous for his refusal to suppress the Kapp Putsch with the remark: "Reichswehr do not fire on Reichswehr". In recent years, he was elected to parliament under the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?], gradually drifting further to the radical right. He even appeared as a featured speaker at the Harzburg Rally. Now returned from a military advisory mission in China, Seeckt enters the race for the presidency—backed by many of Hindenburg’s former allies and the disgraced Schleicher.

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, recognizing the precariousness of their position, have swallowed their pride and endorsed Seeckt for the presidency. [? if not hindenburg_term_extended: They deem him sufficiently right-wing—after all, he once wrote to his sister urging her to vote for [+ nsdap_candidate_1932 +] in 1932. ?]

The <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> are too disorganized following Schleicher's crackdown, and are unable to field a candidate for president. They will be backing whoever we choose to back, provided it's a <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span>.

Many <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">icans</span> of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?], [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?], and <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> float the idea of running Hugo Eckener, a nationally renowed Zeppelin captain, as a unity candidate. While he has some nationalistic views, he is also ardently opposed to <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>.

Barring that, the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] and [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] are planning to run separate candidates in the first round if the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> runs its own candidate. The [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] is considering nominating Konrad Adenauer, mayor of Köln and member of the Prussian state legislature. He calls for an alliance of conservative Christian democrats that encompasses both Catholics and Protestants. The [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] might nominate Otto Gessler, former defense minister, who has crossover appeal to conservatives in the moderate right and other parties who dislike the renewed <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalist</span>-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> alliance.

As for the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, we could support a joint <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Coalition candidate or run our own.

A leading candidate is Albert Grzesinski of our Reformist faction. Former Interior Minister of Prussia and currently Berlin’s Police Chief, he has played a central role in combating both <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">left</span>-wing extremism. Most notably, he helped organize the general strike that brought down Schleicher. However, his hardline stance against the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>—including his suppression of their demonstrations—has made him unacceptable to them.

Alternatively, we could nominate Otto Wels, our party chairman and leader of the Centrist faction. He is palatable to the bourgeois parties and the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span>, who may begrudgingly tolerate his candidacy.
