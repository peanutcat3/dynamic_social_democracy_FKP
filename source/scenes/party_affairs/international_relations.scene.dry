#subtitle: Building ties with our fraternal socialist parties.

At the <span style="color: #D50032;">Labor and Socialist International</span>, we can forge contacts with our fraternal <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> parties in <span style="color: #001489;">Europe</span> and across the world.

- @fr_uk: Build relationships with the <span style="color: #002654;">French</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">SFIO</span> and <span style="color: #C8102E;">British</span> <span style="color: #f0456a;">Labour Party</span> to move their governments in Germany's favor.
- @austria: Learn organization and street fighting from the <span style="color: #EF3340;">Au</span><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">str</span></span><span style="color: #EF3340;">ian</span> <span style="color: #A50034;">socialists</span>.
- @scandi: Learn the path of economics and reform from the Scandinavian <span style="color: #D70926;">social democrats</span>.
- @comintern: Forget the second international - embed a spy in the <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span>'s conference.
- @america: Contact the <span style="color: #940f0f;">Socialist Party of America</span>.
- @return: We do not need international contacts at the moment.

The <span style="color: #f0456a;">socialists</span> of <span style="color: #002654;">France</span> and <span style="color: #C8102E;">Britain</span> can influence their governments to be friendlier towards Germany. Hopefully they will reduce our reparations burden.

Our Reichsbanner can learn much in paramilitary organization and training from the <span style="color: #EF3340;">Au</span><span style="color: #ffffff;">str</span><span style="color: #EF3340;">ian</span> Republican Protection Units.

The programs of the Nordic <span style="color: #D70926;">socialists</span> involve active government intervention in the economy. We can learn from their economic strategies, and how they moved beyond their working-class base to attract a broader set of constituents.

The <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalinists</span> of the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> insists on calling us "<span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>", suggesting that we <span style="color: #c00000;">social democrats</span>are as bad or worse than actual <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>. Needless to say, this is not good for our relationship with the <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>. By observing the <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span>, we can better understand the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, enabling us to potentially improve relations, or counter the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> if it may come to that.

The <span style="color: #940f0f;">Socialist Party of America</span> is tiny and has limited support. There is not much we can do for them, and conversely, not much they can do for us.

We do not need the international contacts at the moment.
