on-arrival: womens_rights += 1; workers_spd += 3*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 5*(1-dissent); advisor_action_timer = 6

Sender's message is popular among young women working in the service sector, and we have recruited many white-collar employees.

[? if spd_r < 50 : Unfortunately, women still disproportionately support the bourgeois parties. ?]

We have grown tired of the burdens of toleration, and have called a vote of no confidence in the current minority government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

New Prussian elections have been set for [+ next_election_month_prussia : month +] [+ next_election_year_prussia +].

A double dissolution has shaken the people's faith in democracy, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.

While this is a setback, it is not the worst possible outcome, as new elections could have led to significant gains for extremist parties.
