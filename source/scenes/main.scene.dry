Calling [+ nsdap_chancellor +]'s bluff, the president offered to appoint him, but only if he could secure a working majority in the Reichstag and allow the president to pick the defense and foreign ministers himself. As expected, [+ nsdap_chancellor +] declined Hindenburg's proposal and suggested instead that, with emergency powers, he could form a satisfactory government in no time.

{!<p class="other">!}[? if (papen_time or chancellor == "Schleicher") and year == 1932 and month == 12 and week == 1: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> has suffered yet another crushing setback‚Äîthis time in the local elections in Thuringia. The results show the party lost nearly a quarter of its vote share compared to the previous state election. While low turnout may be a factor, this and three other recent local elections have only reinforced the growing sense that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have peaked and are rapidly losing support. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 0 and chancellor == "Schleicher": Despite his ousting, Papen remains in far closer physical proximity to the President than the chancellor does. At Hindenburg‚Äôs personal request, he continues to reside in an apartment within the Interior Ministry building‚Äîjust steps from Hindenburg‚Äôs own quarters‚Äîwhile Schleicher lives miles away in a private residence. This arrangement has enabled Papen to scheme full-time, without attracting public attention. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 0 and chancellor == "Schleicher": Once a close ally, Oskar von Hindenburg has become an implacable enemy of the new chancellor‚Äîreportedly over a tasteless joke that wounded his pride beyond forgiveness. In Prussian times, such insults could end in duels; this time, the fallout may claim the life of the Republic. Two members of the Camarilla now harbor intense hostility toward Schleicher, and are working to sway the President into reconsidering his appointment. ?]{!</p>!}

The practical terms of this concession remain unclear, but in Schleicher‚Äôs view, it opens the path toward establishing an official militia service. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 1: During Schleicher's addresses to the nation, one central theme rings clear: "Create Work!" He has revived efforts to resettle the urban unemployed on rural homesteads carved from bankrupt estates in the sparsely populated East. Although the Reichstag remains dissolved and he cannot legislate, he has publicly opposed Papen‚Äôs changes to the unemployment insurance system, presenting himself as a proponent of neither <span style="color: #C0A054;">capitalism</span> nor <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>. His ideological ambiguity has earned him the nickname "social general"‚Äîa label he embraces, claiming it aligns with the army‚Äôs tradition of solidarity between officers and soldiers. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="dnvp">!}[? if schleicher_time == 1 and hugenberg_dvp: The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s resurgence in the polls has led Dingeldey to become overconfident, unequivocally supporting Papen, then Schleicher, and even forming a parliamentary faction with the various splinter parties between it and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>. While this move has bolstered their influence, it has alienated Hugenberg and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, on whom they still depend on as of their electoral alliance. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 2: For some odd reason, von Schleicher came to believe that nothing came of [+ nsdap_chancellor +]‚Äôs attempts to be appointed parliamentary chancellor simply because the man didn‚Äôt ‚Äúat the bottom of his heart‚Äù want the office. By [+ month : month +], this suspicion had become a firm conviction; he repeatedly confided to journalists and his cabinet that the man simply doesn‚Äôt really want power. This belief is leading to Schleicher overestimating his chances of securing <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> support for his cabinet‚Äîwithout [+ nsdap_chancellor +] as chancellor. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 2: Heavy electoral losses for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> in local elections have further reinforced the disillusionment of the voters who have brought the movement to prominence, many who joined and donated to the party expecting to receive the spoils of victory are beginning to despair, withdrawing their donations. Admission fees for rallies, once a major source of income at the local level, have collapsed despite steep price reductions. [+ nsdap_chancellor +]'s failure to gain the chancellorship or enter government to constructively relieve Germany's economic woes has caused further frustration among the movement. However, <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leaders are quick to suppress any leaks of dissent or rumors of decline to the public. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 3: The global economy is on the upswing‚Äîand with it, the erosion of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> continues.

Resignations are occurring daily, membership dues arrive irregularly, and expulsions over indebtedness are increasingly common. Every branch of the party appears run down. As for morale, the police report observed: ‚ÄúThe view that the peak has passed and favorable prospects are missed is commonly held among many members.‚Äù ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 3: Schleicher still clings to the illusionary hope that the now powerless Strasser might somehow persuade [+ nsdap_chancellor +] to allow <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> participation in his cabinet, now that Strasser has returned from vacation. Strasser‚Äôs absence from the public eye has unsettled [+ nsdap_leader +], who now fears potential backroom plots to fracture the party‚Äîespecially given the eagerness of Strasser‚Äôs remaining loyalists to do just that. In reality, all Strasser does is to warn former chancellor Br√ºning that Papen has arranged a secret meeting with Hitler‚Äîset to take place within a week or two‚Äîto conspire against their mutual enemy: Schleicher. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 4 and nazi_funds <= 1: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>'s financial situation is becoming dire. Increasingly, equipment and supplies are being acquired on credit‚Äîcredit that's already drying up under the weight of the party's existing debts. Tensions have begun to flare between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> and the party leadership over how to divide dwindling donations, with some members resorting to begging in the streets or organizing lotteries to scrape together funds. One more election, and the party could face a full-blown financial crisis. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 4: Despite promising President Hindenburg not to publicly criticize his favored former chancellor, Schleicher has done just that in a bid to distance himself from the deeply unpopular Papen. Hindenburg, displeased by the breach of trust, grows increasingly estranged from Schleicher. Papen, for his part, has shown little outward hostility toward his ouster‚Äîcarefully masking his resentment and thirst for revenge beneath a fa√ßade of cordiality. In the meantime, Hindenburg has quietly authorized him to serve as his secret liaison to [+ nsdap_leader +]. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 4 and not schleicher_public_works_fast: G√ºnther Gereke, the energetic special commissioner for public works, has grown frustrated with the chancellor after a request for intervention to clear bureaucratic obstacles was flatly rejected.

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 4 and schleicher_public_works_fast: G√ºnther Gereke, the energetic special commissioner for public works, has had his project accelerated after his request for the chancellor to intervene and clear bureaucratic obstacles was approved.

{!<p class="other">!}[? if (papen_time or chancellor == "Schleicher") and year == 1933 and month == 1 and week == 1: The campaign for the Landtag elections in the microscopically small Free State of Lippe has begun, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> investing a substantial amount of resources to sway just a hundred thousand voters. However, despite its small size, a victory here could dispel the growing belief that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> are on the brink of a catastrophic decline. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 5: At a private dinner with journalists, Chancellor von Schleicher repeatedly expressed confidence that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leader would eventually come around to tolerating his cabinet‚Äîdespite [+ nsdap_leader +]‚Äôs public affirmations of an all-or-nothing course. This, even as Schleicher made clear he would dissolve the Reichstag if needed, a move he believes would cost the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> further seats (though he seeks to avoid such a step, fearing the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> would benefit most from their collapse). ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll soon be eating out of my hand,‚Äù were the chancellor‚Äôs exact words that evening. What Schleicher fails to grasp is that [+ nsdap_leader +] is no ordinary politician. He will not respond rationally, nor prudently, to Strasser‚Äôs break or to the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>‚Äôs electoral collapse. He believes destiny is on his side. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 5: Chancellor von Schleicher and his press secretary have deliberately ‚Äúleaked‚Äù plans to appoint Strasser as Vice Chancellor, Interior Minister, and Minister-President of Prussia, alongside naming the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> labor leader Stegerwald as Labor Minister. The Agriculture and Economics Ministries were reportedly reserved for Hugenberg himself. It‚Äôs highly likely this is a bluff‚Äîan attempt to pressure the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> into dropping its total opposition, lest they risk being sidelined entirely. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="dnvp">!}[? if schleicher_time == 5 and hugenberg_dvp: With Dingeldey's pretentiousness, fueled by the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s uptick in polling, elevating it to the lead party on the "moderate" Right, Hugenberg is growing increasingly irritated by their independence and seeks to terminate their electoral alliance if new elections are called. While the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> still hopes to renew the alliance, they begin exploring the possibility of an accommodation with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and the bourgeois parties as a safeguard against near-certain annihilation if Hugenberg severs ties. Meanwhile, the DNV (German National Association), a non-partisan organization aiming to consolidate the German middle, is starting to repair its relations with the liberals after already securing the support of the non-liberal right, with politicians like Treviranus. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 6: Von Schleicher's bluffs‚Äîsuch as proposing a cabinet that includes both Stegerwald and Hugenberg‚Äîhave lost all credibility. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has publicly ruled out Stegerwald serving alongside Hugenberg, a notorious enemy of organized labor. Moreover, the leak about the President‚Äôs meeting with Strasser has led to a permanent break between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leader and Schleicher, ending any hope that Strasser might persuade him to support a cabinet involving Schleicher. His contradictory tactics and careless remarks have only deepened mistrust and furthered his political isolation. He only now condemns efforts to postpone elections‚Äîdespite having supported the idea just a week earlier. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 6: With progress stalled across nearly all sectors, Schleicher has attempted to shift focus by bringing the issue of rearmament back into the public eye. He announced plans to establish a compulsory militia within a year, alongside a renewed commitment to arming the Reichswehr with heavy weaponry and instituting universal conscription. However, the impact of this intended public relations triumph is minimal, as news of Schleicher‚Äôs political setbacks dominates public attention. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="dnvp">!}[? if schleicher_time == 6: Having failed to extract concessions from the chancellor to turn Germany into a dictatorship, the more radical elements within his party have pressured him into adopting an all-out opposition to Schleicher. A strongly worded resolution has been released, accusing him of "vacillation" in his willingness to "reform" the constitution. Furthermore, his initiative to restart peasant homesteads on bankrupt eastern estates has drawn the ire of conservative elites. With the next vote of no confidence looming, it may well come down to Schleicher versus the entire chamber. ?]{!</p>!}

This crisis presented a perfect opportunity for Dollfu√ü to abolish the parliamentary system and restrict democratic rights, such as the freedom of the press and public protests. Another democracy has fell to authoritarianism. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1934 and month = 2 and (week == 2 or not rubicon) and not austrian_parliament_seen: The Austrian Civil War has begun and ended in a matter of three days, fought between the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Republican Protection League</span> and Austria's <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascist</span> regime, resulting in a defeat for the <span style="color: #C8102E;">socialists</span> across the border. The uprising was sparked by efforts to suppress the remnants of the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span> and their paramilitary wing.

{!<p class="other">!}[? if ((flavour_61_trigger_time == time and not rubicon) or (flavour_61_trigger_time == rubicon_time and rubicon)): Following another disastrous result for the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, a group of six former Reichstag deputies and high-ranking party members informed [+ ddp_leader +] that if a party congress‚Äîspecifically meant to dissolve the party‚Äîisn't held, they would leave. However, this call has not gained much support, and Carl Petersen, former <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> chairman, has used his mediation skills to prevent the dissidents from publicly announcing their break with the party. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1932 and month = 11 and (week == 1 or not rubicon): <span style="color: #00AEF3;">Democrat</span> Franklin D. Roosevelt has defeated incumbent <span style="color: #E81B23;">Republican</span> President Herbert Hoover in a landslide in the <span style="color: #B31942;">United</span> <span style="color: #0A3161;">States</span> presidential election. This is attributed by the Great Depression and Roosevelt's campaigning for a "New Deal", proposing expansive public works and government reform. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if papen_time == 22 and papen_post_2: Rumors are circulating widely that General Schleicher intends to undermine the very chancellor he helped install. Among his contacts, he's already being referred to as the chancellor-designate. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if papen_time == 23 and papen_post_2: President Hindenburg has commissioned [+ z_leader +] to make one final attempt at forming a majority coalition. Reporting back the next day, [+ z_leader +] confirmed that no such majority could be assembled. His recommendation was blunt: the only way forward is for the President to dismiss Papen, as the Reichstag will never accept him as chancellor. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if (papen_time or chancellor == "Schleicher") and year == 1932 and month == 12 and week == 1: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> has suffered yet another crushing setback‚Äîthis time in the local elections in Thuringia. The results show the party lost nearly a quarter of its vote share compared to the previous state election. While low turnout may be a factor, this and three other recent local elections have only reinforced the growing sense that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> have peaked and are rapidly losing support. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 0 and chancellor == "Schleicher": Despite his ousting, Papen remains in far closer physical proximity to the President than the chancellor does. At Hindenburg‚Äôs personal request, he continues to reside in an apartment within the Interior Ministry building‚Äîjust steps from Hindenburg‚Äôs own quarters‚Äîwhile Schleicher lives miles away in a private residence. This arrangement has enabled Papen to scheme full-time, without attracting public attention. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 0 and chancellor == "Schleicher": Once a close ally, Oskar von Hindenburg has become an implacable enemy of the new chancellor‚Äîreportedly over a tasteless joke that wounded his pride beyond forgiveness. In Prussian times, such insults could end in duels; this time, the fallout may claim the life of the Republic. Two members of the Camarilla now harbor intense hostility toward Schleicher, and are working to sway the President into reconsidering his appointment. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 0 and chancellor == "Schleicher": Shortly after Schleicher‚Äôs appointment, the <span style="color: #0A3161;">Western</span> <span style="color: #C8102E;">Allies</span>, following protracted negotiations at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, conceded in principle to Germany‚Äôs right to equality in arms. The practical terms of this concession remain unclear, but in Schleicher‚Äôs view, it opens the path toward establishing an official militia service. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 1: During Schleicher's addresses to the nation, one central theme rings clear: "Create Work!" He has revived efforts to resettle the urban unemployed on rural homesteads carved from bankrupt estates in the sparsely populated East. Although the Reichstag remains dissolved and he cannot legislate, he has publicly opposed Papen‚Äôs changes to the unemployment insurance system, presenting himself as a proponent of neither <span style="color: #C0A054;">capitalism</span> nor <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>. His ideological ambiguity has earned him the nickname "social general"‚Äîa label he embraces, claiming it aligns with the army‚Äôs tradition of solidarity between officers and soldiers. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="dnvp">!}[? if schleicher_time == 1 and hugenberg_dvp: The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s resurgence in the polls has led Dingeldey to become overconfident, unequivocally supporting Papen, then Schleicher, and even forming a parliamentary faction with the various splinter parties between it and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>. While this move has bolstered their influence, it has alienated Hugenberg and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, on whom they still depend on as of their electoral alliance. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 2: For some odd reason, von Schleicher came to believe that nothing came of [+ nsdap_chancellor +]‚Äôs attempts to be appointed parliamentary chancellor simply because the man didn‚Äôt ‚Äúat the bottom of his heart‚Äù want the office. By [+ month : month +], this suspicion had become a firm conviction; he repeatedly confided to journalists and his cabinet that the man simply doesn‚Äôt really want power. This belief is leading to Schleicher overestimating his chances of securing <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> support for his cabinet‚Äîwithout [+ nsdap_chancellor +] as chancellor. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 2: Heavy electoral losses for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> in local elections have further reinforced the disillusionment of the voters who have brought the movement to prominence, many who joined and donated to the party expecting to receive the spoils of victory are beginning to despair, withdrawing their donations. Admission fees for rallies, once a major source of income at the local level, have collapsed despite steep price reductions. [+ nsdap_chancellor +]'s failure to gain the chancellorship or enter government to constructively relieve Germany's economic woes has caused further frustration among the movement. However, <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leaders are quick to suppress any leaks of dissent or rumors of decline to the public. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 3: The global economy is on the upswing‚Äîand with it, the erosion of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> continues. The <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> police force surveilling the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> in Munich has noted clear signs of disintegration. Resignations are occurring daily, membership dues arrive irregularly, and expulsions over indebtedness are increasingly common. Every branch of the party appears run down. As for morale, the police report observed: ‚ÄúThe view that the peak has passed and favorable prospects are missed is commonly held among many members.‚Äù ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 3: Schleicher still clings to the illusionary hope that the now powerless Strasser might somehow persuade [+ nsdap_chancellor +] to allow <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> participation in his cabinet, now that Strasser has returned from vacation. Strasser‚Äôs absence from the public eye has unsettled [+ nsdap_leader +], who now fears potential backroom plots to fracture the party‚Äîespecially given the eagerness of Strasser‚Äôs remaining loyalists to do just that. In reality, all Strasser does is to warn former chancellor Br√ºning that Papen has arranged a secret meeting with Hitler‚Äîset to take place within a week or two‚Äîto conspire against their mutual enemy: Schleicher. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 4 and nazi_funds <= 1: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>'s financial situation is becoming dire. Increasingly, equipment and supplies are being acquired on credit‚Äîcredit that's already drying up under the weight of the party's existing debts. Tensions have begun to flare between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> and the party leadership over how to divide dwindling donations, with some members resorting to begging in the streets or organizing lotteries to scrape together funds. One more election, and the party could face a full-blown financial crisis. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 4: Despite promising President Hindenburg not to publicly criticize his favored former chancellor, Schleicher has done just that in a bid to distance himself from the deeply unpopular Papen. Hindenburg, displeased by the breach of trust, grows increasingly estranged from Schleicher. Papen, for his part, has shown little outward hostility toward his ouster‚Äîcarefully masking his resentment and thirst for revenge beneath a fa√ßade of cordiality. In the meantime, Hindenburg has quietly authorized him to serve as his secret liaison to [+ nsdap_leader +]. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 4 and not schleicher_public_works_fast: G√ºnther Gereke, the energetic special commissioner for public works, has grown frustrated with the chancellor after a request for intervention to clear bureaucratic obstacles was flatly rejected. His ambitious projects remain stalled. Gereke, disillusioned, has confided his disappointment to his close friend‚Äînone other than Oskar von Hindenburg. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 4 and schleicher_public_works_fast: G√ºnther Gereke, the energetic special commissioner for public works, has had his project accelerated after his request for the chancellor to intervene and clear bureaucratic obstacles was approved. [? if schleicher_spd_r >= 4: Schleicher's eagerness to follow through on his promise to satisfy the unions and the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, and to put additional pressure on the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> before their electoral base returns to work, has driven this decision. ?][? if schleicher_spd_r < 4 and workers_nsdap_normalized + workers_kpd_normalized >= 55: Schleicher's eagerness to fulfill his promise to the unions, and to curb the growing <span style="color: #700000;">**Communist**</span> vote share among radicalized workers, has motivated the move. ?][? if schleicher_spd_r < 4 and workers_nsdap_normalized + workers_kpd_normalized < 55 and unemployed >= 42: The disastrous state of the German economy has made rearmament a pipe dream, and Schleicher is eager to get it back on track. ?] ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if (papen_time or chancellor == "Schleicher") and year == 1933 and month == 1 and week == 1: The campaign for the Landtag elections in the microscopically small Free State of Lippe has begun, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> investing a substantial amount of resources to sway just a hundred thousand voters. However, despite its small size, a victory here could dispel the growing belief that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> are on the brink of a catastrophic decline. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 5: At a private dinner with journalists, Chancellor von Schleicher repeatedly expressed confidence that the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leader would eventually come around to tolerating his cabinet‚Äîdespite [+ nsdap_leader +]‚Äôs public affirmations of an all-or-nothing course. This, even as Schleicher made clear he would dissolve the Reichstag if needed, a move he believes would cost the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> further seats (though he seeks to avoid such a step, fearing the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> would benefit most from their collapse). ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll soon be eating out of my hand,‚Äù were the chancellor‚Äôs exact words that evening. What Schleicher fails to grasp is that [+ nsdap_leader +] is no ordinary politician. He will not respond rationally, nor prudently, to Strasser‚Äôs break or to the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>‚Äôs electoral collapse. He believes destiny is on his side. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 5: Chancellor von Schleicher and his press secretary have deliberately ‚Äúleaked‚Äù plans to appoint Strasser as Vice Chancellor, Interior Minister, and Minister-President of Prussia, alongside naming the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> labor leader Stegerwald as Labor Minister. The Agriculture and Economics Ministries were reportedly reserved for Hugenberg himself. It‚Äôs highly likely this is a bluff‚Äîan attempt to pressure the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> into dropping its total opposition, lest they risk being sidelined entirely. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="dnvp">!}[? if schleicher_time == 5 and hugenberg_dvp: With Dingeldey's pretentiousness, fueled by the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s uptick in polling, elevating it to the lead party on the "moderate" Right, Hugenberg is growing increasingly irritated by their independence and seeks to terminate their electoral alliance if new elections are called. While the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> still hopes to renew the alliance, they begin exploring the possibility of an accommodation with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and the bourgeois parties as a safeguard against near-certain annihilation if Hugenberg severs ties. Meanwhile, the DNV (German National Association), a non-partisan organization aiming to consolidate the German middle, is starting to repair its relations with the liberals after already securing the support of the non-liberal right, with politicians like Treviranus. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 6: Von Schleicher's bluffs‚Äîsuch as proposing a cabinet that includes both Stegerwald and Hugenberg‚Äîhave lost all credibility. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> has publicly ruled out Stegerwald serving alongside Hugenberg, a notorious enemy of organized labor. Moreover, the leak about the President‚Äôs meeting with Strasser has led to a permanent break between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> leader and Schleicher, ending any hope that Strasser might persuade him to support a cabinet involving Schleicher. His contradictory tactics and careless remarks have only deepened mistrust and furthered his political isolation. He only now condemns efforts to postpone elections‚Äîdespite having supported the idea just a week earlier. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 6: With progress stalled across nearly all sectors, Schleicher has attempted to shift focus by bringing the issue of rearmament back into the public eye. He announced plans to establish a compulsory militia within a year, alongside a renewed commitment to arming the Reichswehr with heavy weaponry and instituting universal conscription. However, the impact of this intended public relations triumph is minimal, as news of Schleicher‚Äôs political setbacks dominates public attention. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="dnvp">!}[? if schleicher_time == 6: Having failed to extract concessions from the chancellor to turn Germany into a dictatorship, the more radical elements within his party have pressured him into adopting an all-out opposition to Schleicher. A strongly worded resolution has been released, accusing him of "vacillation" in his willingness to "reform" the constitution. Furthermore, his initiative to restart peasant homesteads on bankrupt eastern estates has drawn the ire of conservative elites. With the next vote of no confidence looming, it may well come down to Schleicher versus the entire chamber. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 7: The Rubicon has been crossed, and Schleicher stands on the other side. (keep in mind, all future content is highly speculative) ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if schleicher_time == 8: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> Party is in total disarray, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>‚Äîthe most rebellious faction‚Äîhas been the first to fall. Ernst R√∂hm[? if rohm_explode:, now released from prison?], disillusioned with [+ nsdap_leader +]'s direction, has been quietly scheming in recent days. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1933 and month = 3 and not ((spd_in_government and foreign_minister_party = "SPD") or (austria_relation >= 1)) and (week == 1 or not rubicon): Dollfu√ü has abused his powers given in the "War Economy Enabling Act" to crack down on the workers in a railroad strike, which has resulted in all three presidents of parliament resigning amid a crucial vote. This crisis presented a perfect opportunity for Dollfu√ü to abolish the parliamentary system and restrict democratic rights, such as the freedom of the press and public protests. Another democracy has fell to authoritarianism. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1933 and month = 5 and (week == 4 or not rubicon) : Dollfu√ü's <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascist</span> dictatorship has banned the <span style="color: #700000;">Austrian Communists</span> and the paramilitary of the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span>, the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Republican Protection League</span>. He has also established the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Fatherland Front</span>, a party promoting a far-right <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascist</span> and corporate ideology. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1933 and month = 11 and (week == 3 or not rubicon): The <span style="color: #EF1C27;">Spanish Socialists</span> and the <span style="color: #E25822;">Republican Left</span> have suffered an overwhelming defeat at the hands of the right wing <span style="color: #303180;">**CEDA**</span> and increasingly right-wing <span style="color: #A871A8;">Radicals</span>. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1934 and month = 2 and (week == 2 or not rubicon) and not austrian_parliament_seen: The Austrian Civil War has begun and ended in a matter of three days, fought between the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Republican Protection League</span> and Austria's <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascist</span> regime, resulting in a defeat for the <span style="color: #C8102E;">socialists</span> across the border. The uprising was sparked by efforts to suppress the remnants of the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span> and their paramilitary wing. However, the poorly coordinated and weakened movement was swiftly crushed by the army. Perhaps things would have gone more differently if they have taken up arms earlier. ?]{!</p>!}
