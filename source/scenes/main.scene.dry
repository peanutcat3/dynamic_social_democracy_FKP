{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1928 and month = 6 : The poor showing for the liberal parties has convinced their leadership that Germany no longer has the luxury of two liberal parties. However, the prospect of a merger is held back by the left <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and the right <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, who are strongly against compromising their own interests.

Stresemann is growing disillusioned with his own party, viewing it as a vehicle for industrial interests rather than liberal values. The leftists in the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> argue that the merger would have to take into account the interests of the working class, a policy vehemently opposed by the industrial interests. ?]{!</p>!}

This is begrudgingly accepted by the extremes of both parties to increase their parliamentary influence with the declining liberal vote. <br><br> A new Liberal Association has been gaining traction with funding from both parties, and are expected to open up state and local chapters and to draft a policy program.

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1928 and n_elections == 1 and next_election_time - time = 2: Our calls for new elections just after the last one have pushed the liberal parties closer together, in order to not face any further decline. A new Liberal Association has emerged coordinating the efforts of the two parties and seems to be the prelude to the founding of a new liberal party, but it's not certain if both parties would fully agree. <br><br> The idea of a liberal parliamentary faction has gained considerable traction with both parties and they are likely to negotiate as a single bloc after the election. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if lvp_merger_timer == 4: The quest towards liberal unity has advanced, with the Liberal Association's influence growing within local chapters of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> chapters on the local level.

[? if in_right_coalition or in_right_coalition_prussia = 1: <br><br> Hugenberg's attempts to increase his influence within the party are complicated by the reality that if he were to bring down the current [? if in_right_coalition_prussia and in_right_coalition: Prussian and federal ?][? if in_right_coalition_prussia and not in_right_coalition: Prussian ?][? if in_right_coalition and not in_right_coalition_prussia: federal ?]coalition when elected, the only viable alternative for a parliamentary majority would be a government led by us. ?] ?]{!</p>!}

Meanwhile, numerous liberal youth organizations have been created with the goal of fostering cooperation between <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> for a united middle party. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="dnvp">!}[? if year = 1928 and month = 9 : Westarp's refusal to run for re-election has left the moderate anti-Hugenberg forces within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> without a candidate. Hugenberg has shown ambivalence in the party chairmanship himself, and has shown interest in a triumvirate of sorts. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if lvp_merger_timer == 2: Those on the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>'s left wing, who remain firmly opposed to a merger of the two parties, are being forced out of the party or sidelined to clear the path for unification. However, the right wing of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> holds significant sway over the party and the negotiations, prompting Stresemann to call for an emergency party congress to resolve the issue. ?]{!</p>!}

He strikes a strong parallel with Lambach in working to expand the party to attract all sectors of society.

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1930 and month = 11 : The <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span> have won the recent legislative election, securing a majority of seats in their *Nationalrat*. However a right-wing coalition of the <span style="color: #000000;">Christian Social Party</span> and minor bourgeois parties once again has excluded them from government. The Austrian branch of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> have received 3% of the vote, and the political wing of the <span style="color: #ABDDA4;">Heimwehr</span> (comparable to our *Freikorps*) garnered 6%. This is particularly concerning, as the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span> lost votes despite the economic depression occurring while they were in opposition, suggesting the electorate is looking for answers on the right. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1931 and month = 4 : The Second Spanish Republic has been established, replacing the monarchy of Alfonso XIII. This follows municipal elections in wich republican candidates scored significant victories, winning in all 41 provincial capitals. This has forced the king into exile and a new, young republic has been created. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if banking_crisis_timer == 1 : The major Austrian Bank Creditanstalt has declared bankruptcy, following <span style="color: #002654;">French</span> political and economic pressures aimed at undermining the plans for the Austro-German customs union. In that respect, they have certainly succeeded. We can only hope that this crisis does not spill over into Germany or, worse, spread across Europe. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1931 and month = 6 : The first elections of the Second Spanish Republic has been held, with it a great victory for the <span style="color: #EF1C27;">Spanish Socialists</span> and the <span style="color: #E25822;">Republican Left</span>.

Despite this, the incumbent <span style="color: #008000;">National Labour</span> Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald has remained in office, ruling with the <span style="color: #0087DC;">Tories</span>. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1931 and month = 12 : The new Second Spanish Republic has adopted its new democratic constitution, establishing a secular, progressive, and republican government. Times are looking bright for Spain. ?]{!</p>!}

However, the <span style="color: #F0001C;">**SFIO**</span> has refused to participate in government, prompting the <span style="color: #E0B0FF;">Radical Socialists</span> to form a coalition with the center-right instead. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1932 and month = 5 : The Austrian government has resigned due to the significant gains of the Austrian <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> in recent local elections, leading to Engelbert Dollfuß being appointed chancellor by the President. Dollfuß now rules in a coalition with the <span style="color: #ABDDA4;">Heimwehr</span>. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1932 and month = 8 : Austria has obtained a League of Nations loan that is tied to a 20-year ban on Anschluss, but opposition from the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Social Democrats</span> and <span style="color: #0E428E;">Greater German Party</span> has stalled the law, before it finally is passed by a single vote. ?]{!</p>!}

The <span style="color: #D70926;">Swedish Social Democrats</span> have embraced the concept of a 'people's home', a form of reformist socialism aimed at reducing class divides while working in the capitalist framework. Perhap we should consider following their 'nordic' model? ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1932 and month = 10 : Chancellor of Austria Engelbert Dollfuß has used the "War Economy Enabling Act", a law passed during the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which allowed him to restructure the Creditanstalt without parliamentary approval. While the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span> have protested, Dollfuß' actions are technically legal. ?]{!</p>!}

This is attributed by the Great Depression and Roosevelt's campaigning for a "New Deal", proposing expansive public works and government reform. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1933 and month = 3 and not ((spd_in_government and foreign_minister_party = "SPD") or (austria_relation >= 1)): Dollfuß has abused his powers given in the "War Economy Enabling Act" to crack down on the workers in a railroad strike, which has resulted in all three presidents of parliament resigning amid a crucial vote. This crisis presented a perfect opportunity for Dollfuß to abolish the parliamentary system and restrict democratic rights, such as the freedom of the press and public protests. Another democracy has fell to authoritarianism. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1933 and month = 5 : Dollfuß's <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascist</span> dictatorship has banned the <span style="color: #700000;">Austrian Communists</span> and the paramilitary of the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span>, the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Republican Protection League</span>.

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1934 and month = 2 and not austrian_parliament_seen: The Austrian Civil War has begun and ended in a matter of three days, fought between the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Republican Protection League</span> and Austria's <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascist</span> regime, resulting in a defeat for the <span style="color: #C8102E;">socialists</span> across the border. The uprising was sparked by efforts to suppress the remnants of the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span> and their paramilitary wing. However, the poorly coordinated and weakened movement was swiftly crushed by the army. Perhaps things would have gone more differently if they have taken up arms earlier. ?]{!</p>!}
