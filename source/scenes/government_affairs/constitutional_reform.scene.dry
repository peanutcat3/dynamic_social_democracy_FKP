#subtitle: Major changes to government.

# technically you could do some trickery to get a 2/3 quorum in the Reichstag by stopping some people from attending... if the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> is boycotting the Reichstag, or if the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> or <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> are banned in the aftermath of a coup atempt...

# alternatively, a constitutional referendum can be initiated, that requires a simple majority of voters to pass (as I understand article 76). This should depend on support for the republic and for democracy, and the relationships with the other parties (more similar to the presidential election).

= Constitutional Reform

# the ideas for constitutional reform here are based on the bundesrepublik basic law... I'm not sure if it's totally realistic to what someone like Mierendorff would've wanted.

Many neorevisionists consider the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Constitution to be inadequate. They believe that the clauses of the constitution are in part responsible for the instability of the country, and must change in order to build a more stable democratic republic. Ideas from both <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">liberals</span>.

A constitutional reform requires either a two-thirds supermajority in the Reichstag, or a constitutional referendum with support from a majority of the electorate. If we do not have a supermajority in the Reichstag, we must be assured of strong support from the other parties for the constitutional referendum.

# The left is opposed to this.

Some political thinkers believe that the proliferation of minor parties is responsible for the instability of the republic. They believe that a higher electoral threshold will reduce the influence of small radical parties. Parties that win a plurality in a constituency will maintain their representation, a gift to regional parties such as the <span style="color: #A2D8E0;">**BVP**</span>. 

The smaller parties will obviously oppose this reform.

# this should result in a redistribution of votes - other parties should not get so many votes anymore. maybe ddp and dvp get a recovery of middle-class votes? or maybe they flow to the others.

# TODO: add bourgeois mergers cuz of this

We have passed a constitutional amendment to increase the electoral threshold to 5%. This is likely to benefit the larger parties and harm the smaller ones.

The wide-ranging presidential powers promised by the constitution are a potential gateway to <span style="color: #808080;">authoritarianism</span>. Thus, we can support reforms that limit the powers of the president, ending his power to unilaterally terminate an elected government and to remove state governments.

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is in favor of this reform, having been victims of the *Reichsexekution* in the past (when <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>-supported state governments in Thuringia and Saxony were removed).
