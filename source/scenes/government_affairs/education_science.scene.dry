# - scientific education - focus on the sciences, mathematics, and technical skills (+ NMC, science)
# - humanistic education - focus on literature, history, and philosophy. (+ NMC, pro_republic if democratization is high)

= Education and Science

Education in Germany is an area of mixed responsibility between the state governments and the central government. The <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Constitution claims that schools are the domain of the central government, but in practice much of it is left to the states, as the Reichstag has historically been unable to pass an education law. Currently, with our control of Prussia and the Chancellorship, we can try to set policy for a large part of the country.

<span style="color: #9b0000;">Socialism</span> has always stood for science and rationality. Despite the setbacks of the Great War, hyperinflation, and the politicized and <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> attitudes of many academics, science in the German Republic is still the envy of the world. With a great expansion of funding, we hope to keep it that way, and expand on our achievements.

The Kaiser Wilhelm Society is one of the most respected scientific research institutions in the world, with physicist Albert Einstein as its most famous employee. Our research program is to provide the Society with additional resources to hire and train scientists and conduct fundamental research, based on the scientists' own interests.

Our research program focuses on collaborating with industry to develop useful technologies, creating new research institutions for applied science. This collaboration is focused on economic growth and development.

We have cut funding for science. This has a negative effect on our economic growth, and unemployed scientists are less likely to support the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.


@structure
title: Change the structure and funding of education.

Education in Germany has traditionally been organized on religious and class lines. Schools are often either Protestant or Catholic (or rarely <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jewish</span>), and religious classes are required in most mixed-denomination schools. In addition, the working class has at most eight years of public education in primary and middle schools, while the middle and upper classes have access to private schools and Gymnasiums that prepare students for universities. Thus, the universities tend to be dominated by <span style="color: #3E88B3;">conservatives</span> and <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>, which has negative consequences for bureaucratic recruitment.

Many <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> believe that education in Germany is not fit for the modern era.

Our educational curriculum should be focused on the humanities, including arts, literature, history, and philosophy. Some criticize this curriculum as focusing too much on "useless" subjects, while others worry that the arts establishment is too closely tied to romantic nationalism.
