= Coalition Affairs

Our coalition is in trouble. The right-leaning members of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] [? if in_grand_coalition and not lvp_formed: and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> ?][? if lvp_formed: and <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> ?] are constantly criticizing us for our policies, and are threatening to call a vote of no confidence to collapse this government[? if spd_prussia :, or to do the same for our government in the state of Prussia?].

How do we reduce tensions with the coalition?

Letting the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> into the Prussian government is an offer too good for them to refuse, no matter their leadership. 

However, this has negatively impacted our freedom of action we previously had in the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> coalition.

Fine. We no longer control the government of Prussia. The vote has been called off.

The Minister-President position is transferred to the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?].

Fine. By cutting welfare, we have reduced dissent within the coalition.

By transferring campaign funds to our coalition partners, we can make our policies more acceptable to them. Some would call this corruption, but perhaps it is necessary to save democracy.

@no_change

No. We will not do this.

go-to: elections if bruning_event_seen or year < 1930

We have called for a vote of no confidence in ourselves, and have brought down this government. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] currently rules as acting chancellor.

[? if not bruning_event_seen and year >= 1930: New elections haven't been called yet but it's likely that they will be soon, considering Brüning most likely doesn't have the majority of the Reichstag behind him. ?]

@elections
call: set_next_election_time

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
