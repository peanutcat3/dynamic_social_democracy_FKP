= Prussian Affairs

Prussia, by far the largest and most important state in Germany, is governed by our party, in a coalition with the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?], [? if ddp_name == "DDP": <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**Democratic**</span>?][? if ddp_name == "DStP": <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**State**</span>?] and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**People's**</span> parties. It is a stable and democratic state government in Germany, led by [? if prussia_leader == "Braun": the able Otto Braun?][? if prussia_leader == "Brüning": Heinrich Brüning?][? if prussia_leader == "Stegerwald": Adam Stegerwald?].

We can enact policies in Prussia. The inclusion of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> will mitigate our effect.

view-if: prussian_police_loyalty < 1
on-arrival: prussian_police_loyalty += 0.08

The police have historically been overrun with <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>, and we are trying to change this, little by little. We have improved the training and recruitment process to select for a broader demographic than the traditional <span style="color: #3E88B3;">conservatives</span>, and to put a tighter leash on their political activity. In addition, we set up committees to investigate the ranks of the police and remove those with <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> sympathies. It is a slow and arduous work.

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> is sabotaging against our efforts in favor for the right.

Current police loyalty: [+ prussian_police_loyalty : loyalty +].

@police_strength
on-arrival: prussian_police_strength += 15

We have increased the size of the Prussian police.

@bureaucracy
on-arrival: prussian_police_loyalty += 0.03; nationalism -= 2; pacifism += 1; democratization += 1; pro_republic += 2*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 4; new_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent) if democratization >= 5; coup_progress += 0.5; ddp_left += 0.5

The bureaucracy is deeply <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span>, and many abuse their power to favor the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">political right</span>. By removing the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">pro-monarchy</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">pro-dictatorship</span> elements, we can democratize it. Some of our opponents claim that we are infringing on individual freedoms, but perhaps the security of the republic requires it.

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> fills up the bureaucracy with their own monarchist and industrialist sympathizers.

As it turns out, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has many allies in the police and bureaucracy, such as in the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if sa_banned_pro : Nevertheless, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is substantially weakened by our ban. ?] 

[? if coup_progress >= 6: There are reports of an imminent coup by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. We have disrupted some of these plans, but the threat is still present. ?]

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is no longer banned. They immediately go on a recruiting spree.

view-if: sh_banned == 0

[? if president == "Hindenburg": Banning the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> weakens our relationship with President Hindenburg, as well as the political <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and the police. ?][? if president != "Hindenburg": Banning the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> weakens our relationship with the political <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and the police. ?] [? if spd_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and president = "Hindenburg" : It also weakens our coalition due to the influence of Hindenburg on the <span style="color: #C0A054;">right</span> wing of our coalition. ?] In addition, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> still operates out of public sight. 

@unban_sh
view-if: sh_banned = 1
on-arrival: sh_banned = 0; sh_strength += 100; coup_progress += 2 if sh_coup_progress >= 6; hindenburg_angry -= 5

The ban is enthusiastically carried out by the police, perhaps too enthusiastically. The <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span> take this as one more reason why the <span style="color: #c00000;">Socialists</span> are traitors to the <span style="color: #9B0000;">left</span>. However, the <span style="color: #000000;">moderate</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">center-right</span> parties approve, as do the police.

@unban_rfb
view-if: rfb_banned = 1
on-arrival: rfb_banned = 0; rfb_strength += 50; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.1; hindenburg_angry += 8

We are making progress towards negotiating a concordat between Prussia and the Catholic church.

We have signed a Concordat between the Free State of Prussia and the Roman Catholic Church, guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics in Prussia. This sets the stage for the negotiation of a national Concordat covering all of Germany.

[? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": The Catholic members of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> in Prussia are in open conflict with their leadership over the vote, with many leaving the party. ?] The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> has gotten into strong disagreements with the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?].
