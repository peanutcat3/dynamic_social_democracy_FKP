= Dealing with Toleration

We are currently acting as external support to the government of Chancellor [+ chancellor +], although our influence is weakened by his inclusion of [? if not cvp_formed: the?][? if cvp_formed: former?] <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>[? if cvp_formed:&nbsp;members?]. How should we use our position?

Are we sure about this? A vote of no confidence would trigger new elections, and potentially an increased vote-share for the extremist parties.

- @vonc: Yes, end this arrangement!

We have called for a vote of no confidence, and have brought down this government. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] currently rules as acting chancellor.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The [? if not cvp_formed: <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] has called a retaliatory vote in Prussia, forcing the dissolution of the Landtag for new elections.

New Prussian elections have been set for [+ next_election_month_prussia : month +] [+ next_election_year_prussia +].

A double dissolution has shaken the people's faith in democracy, with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.

Carl Severing and other Prussian officials have successfully urged Brüning to issue an emergency decree expanding police authority to suppress political extremism. The decree imposes restrictions on political meetings, organizations, newspapers, and posters, all of which now require police approval beforehand.

As a result, several <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">Communist</span> newspapers have been banned, triggering violent clashes between their supporters and the police.

We will stay the course of toleration, for the sake of stability.
